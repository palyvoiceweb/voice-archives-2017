During a school board meeting on Tuesday, the board approved a <a href=\"https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/0B_Ha6_cxoBV_NThkemhiV19WR0k\/view\">resolution<\/a>\u00a0that affirms\u00a0PAUSD's support of immigrant students and families, and states PAUSD should be a sanctuary for students.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new resolution is in line with the ideas of a bill by California Democratic Sen. Kevin de Le\u00f3n. According to Patrick McGreevy of the Los Angeles Times, the<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.latimes.com\/politics\/essential\/la-pol-ca-essential-politics-updates-senate-leader-proposes-safe-zones-at-1481144070-htmlstory.html\">new bill by de Le\u00f3n<\/a>\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">will outline the implementation of \"safe zones\" for immigrants in locations like public schools, medical facilities and places of worship, which will prohibit immigration enforcement on such locations.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\nUnder this proposed bill, immigrant students would be offered a sort of political protection, according to McGreevy. For de Le\u00f3n, this is a result of concerns raised following statements made about mass-deportation during the 2016 election cycle.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cTo the millions of undocumented residents pursuing and contributing to the California dream, the state of California will be your wall of justice should the incoming administration adopt an inhumane and over-reaching mass-deportation policy,\u201d de Le\u00f3n said in\u00a0reference to the <a href=\"http:\/\/leginfo.legislature.ca.gov\/faces\/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB54\">California Values Act<\/a>.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PAUSD\u2019s own resolution outlines the board\u2019s policy on providing high-quality public education to both children of legal citizens and to those of undocumented residents. It was developed and revised by the board members themselves.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This document ensures the safety of all students in PAUSD, according to Supt. Max McGee, who says he \u201cis proud of the education PAUSD serves to every student.\u201d In a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.pausd.org\/explore-pausd\/news\/superintendents-message-boe-resolution-support-immigrant-students\">statement<\/a>\u00a0released on Thursday, McGee emphasized that PAUSD does not tolerate discrimination based on race, gender, sexual orientation, religion or national origin.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cA<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s educators, we know that students cannot learn when they do not feel welcomed and safe at school,\u201d McGee said in the statement. \u201cFor that reason, we work very hard to create and maintain safe learning environments where teachers, students and other staff members can safely learn and work together.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\nSchools are among a relatively short list of locations deemed as\u00a0\u201csensitive areas\u201d by the United States Department of Immigration and Custom Enforcement. Sensitive areas are locations in which government enforcement action is taken with an air of caution in order to maintain an environment of safety and tranquility, particularly in places of worship, education, ceremonial practices and medical facilities. The Immigration and Custom Enforcement policy also discourages enforcement actions at schools, except in cases of imminent danger.\r\n\r\nThe resolution states that PAUSD officials will not cooperate with immigration enforcement actions unless specifically required to do so by law, but will not interfere with necessary action carried out by law enforcement. For instance, district staff must respond to questions about students from immigration officers, but will refer them first to the\u00a0Supt. or his designee, \u201cunless there is an immediate threat to public safety.\u201d Additionally, the resolution states that \u201cPAUSD will not disclose personally identifiable information in a student's \u2018educational records\u2019 to outside agencies without written parental consent, judicial order, or lawfully-issued subpoena.\u201d\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the passing of this resolution, the Board of Education and Paly administration will be working together to ensure that PAUSD is a \u201csanctuar[y] for students to the fullest extent allowed by law,\u201d McGee said.<\/span>","excerpt":"During a school board meeting on Tuesday, the board approved a resolution that affirms PAUSD's support of immigrant students and families, and states PAUSD should be a sanctuary for students.","date":"2017-01-15 18:14:01","author":"Bianca Al-Shamari","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/schoolboard051016.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":["Board of Education","california valuea act","immigrants","Kevin de Leon","McGee","PAUSD","resolution","senate leader","Trump"]},{"id":127942,"title":"Slideshow: Paly girls dominate Mountain View","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2017\/01\/14\/slideshow-paly-girls-dominate-mountain-view\/","content":"The Palo Alto High School girls' basketball team (9-3, 3-0) continued their undefeated season in league play, defeating the Mountain View Spartans 61-47.\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/143ywtI4gQtX54hGMda6xvVbcNKNSIRIVwgrcAcNDaAA\/embed?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=3000\" width=\"650\" height=\"400\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe>","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School girls' basketball team (9-3, 3-0) continued their undefeated season in league play, defeating the Mountain View Spartans 61-47.\r\n\r\n","date":"2017-01-14 10:53:16","author":"Kasra Orumchian","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/IMG_85731.jpg","categories":["Slideshow","Sports"],"tags":["2016","basketball","carly leong","CCS","girls","gunn","juniors","new","palo alto","palo alto high school","paly","review","School","seniors","skylar burris","slideshow","sports","student","vikings"]},{"id":127849,"title":"Girls&#8217; soccer hopes to stay undefeated against Homestead","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2017\/01\/12\/girls-soccer-hopes-to-stay-undefeated-against-homestead\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_127359\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"596\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/IMG_7891.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-127359\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/IMG_7891.jpg\" alt=\"Senior midfielder Talia Malchin passes the ball upfield against Gunn in December.

Kienitz poses outside the Performing Arts Center for his Senior Portrait. While he may play classical for theater's production of The Importance of Being Earnest, or come up with zany beats as his character, jNitz, Kienitz is found listening to different music than he plays in public.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThis week, The Paly Voice sat down with senior rapper Jackson Kienitz to discuss his musical inspirations.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Palo Alto High School senior Jackson Kienitz, is a part-time student, part-time rapper, known around campus for his satirical persona as the vain and self-important artist jNitz. For this installment of Tuesday Tunes, the Paly Voice will not be talking to this humorous caricature, but to the real Kienitz, to find out what music he plays when he isn\u2019t performing on a stage.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Kienitz, music was something he and his dad always shared, exchanging discoveries between each other as they blasted songs throughout the house.\u00a0Kienitz's dad got the ball rolling by introducing him to some of his first artists. Little did he know that the enthusiasm he instilled in him would manifest itself into Kienitz's\u00a0own artist, years later.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWhen I was a youngster, we'd listen to his various albums everyday on the way to school, whether it be John Mayer, Lenny Kravitz, Kanye West, KT Tunstal or something else,\u201d Kienitz said. \u201cAs I've grown older and started to discover artists and songs on my own, the roles have almost reversed.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kienitz explained how his taste evolved over the years, as what he would listen to on his own permuted periodically, expanding his range of exposure.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIn elementary school, I wasn't actively searching for music, but my iPod consisted of Jackson 5, Queen, Weird Al Yankovic, a random song from The Simpson's and so on,\u201d Kienitz said.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kienitz didn\u2019t \u00a0purposefully start exploring new musicians until middle school, when his tastes diverged into newer genres, but mainly consisted of alternative artists like The Black Keys, White Stripes and Gary Clark Jr. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cCurrently I'm listening to a lot of R&amp;B, Funk, and Hip-Hop but also Folk and of course, \u00a0Post-Neo-Modernist-Contemporary,\u201d Kienitz said, the last being a playful jab at the pretentious style expressed by his alternative alias.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kienitz shared that his favorite artists include Kendrick Lamar, Frank Ocean, Vulfpeck, Jake Bugg and James Blake.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To show a sample size of what you can find Kienitz listening to, The Paly Voice has consolidated a Top 15 list since there are too many favorites to scale down to ten.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/embed.spotify.com\/?uri=spotify%3Auser%3Ajwylder%3Aplaylist%3A3W3cYVv9BwogKmRJWRHhNl\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"This week, The Paly Voice sat down with senior rapper Jackson Kienitz to discuss his musical inspirations.","date":"2017-01-10 19:58:00","author":"Donnesh Farmanfarmaian","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/15133829_1081432702002865_527032860_o.jpg","categories":["A&amp;E Section Spotlight","Tuesday Tunes"],"tags":["entertainment","jackson kienitz","jNitz","music","Tuesday Tunes"]},{"id":127784,"title":"Paly debater wins out-of-state tournament","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2017\/01\/10\/paly-debater-wins-out-of-state-tournament\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_127816\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/DSC_0076.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-127816\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/DSC_0076.jpg\" alt=\"Palo Alto High School junior debater Frances Zhuang poses in front of the Media Arts Center on Tuesday.

Zhuang placed first at a debate tournament at the University of Puget Sound this weekend. Photo: Emma van der Veen.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nPalo Alto High School Speech and Debate team member junior Frances Zhuang placed first in the Lincoln-Douglas Open Division at the 83rd Annual Puget Sound High School Tournament this weekend in Tacoma, Washington.\r\n\r\nZhuang, a third-year debater, says that her exemplary performance was a result of team support, individual preparation and practice in speaking and thinking on the spot.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis [tournament] was definitely one of my personal bests,\u201d Zhuang said. \u201cMy teammates all competed there and the way we worked together to help each other out was unbelievable. This put me in great spirits and contributed to my in-round confidence and poise.\u201d\r\n\r\nZhuang \u00a0argued on the topic of freedom of speech on college campus.\r\n\r\n\"I did a lot more research about the topic this time and I found a bunch of really good arguments in favor of restricting certain kinds of free speech that people weren't expecting, and a lot of reasons why hate speech codes are good,\" Zhuang said. \"The skills I acquired from the last few years of debate helped me become a faster speaker and a more flexible thinker.\u201d\r\n\r\nJunior debater Barry He and senior debater Colin Fee finished as quarterfinalists in the tournament, according to club president senior Ethan Teo. Teo says Paly was additionally awarded four \u201cspeaker awards,\u201d presented to debaters with high average points given for quality of debate strategy and speaking skills in the preliminary rounds of the competition. Paly was awarded 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th places for Zhuang, He, Teo and Fee, respectively.\r\n\r\nAccording to Teo, the Vikings\u2019 performance this weekend was well-deserved.\r\n\r\n\u201cOur team did a phenomenal job this weekend, but I definitely saw it coming,\u201d Teo said. \u201cFrances, Barry and Colin have worked extremely hard on debate, especially this past year, so it's really great to see them perform well at tournaments.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe tournament in Tacoma this weekend is a step towards the Tournament of Champions, the \"World Cup\" of high school debate, according to Zhuang. Zhuang received a bid for the Tournament of Champions because of her performance at this weekend\u2019s competition, placing her halfway to being able to attend the TOC, <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/12\/13\/students-halfway-to-qualifying-for-tournament-of-champions-debate\/\">just like teammates Fee and He<\/a>.\r\n\r\n\u201cI got what we call a 'bid to the TOC' at UPS [University of Puget Sound tournament],\u201d Zhuang said. \u201cThe TOC is the ultimate debate tournament where the best debaters in the country get to compete, and a bid means you're halfway there. Debaters usually need two bids to qualify. Looking forward, my goals are to get another bid to the TOC, to get better at a wider variety of arguments, and to do well at future tournaments.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Teo, the team will compete next weekend in Los Angeles on its next step towards the TOC.","excerpt":"Palo Alto High School Speech and Debate team member junior Frances Zhuang placed first in the Lincoln-Douglas Open Division at the 83rd Annual Puget Sound High School Tournament this weekend in Tacoma, Washington.","date":"2017-01-10 10:37:58","author":"Emma van der Veen","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/DSC_0076.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":["debate","Fee","He","los angeles","palo alto high school","puget sound","speech and debate","tacoma","teo","toc","tournament","Tournament of Champions","University","Washington","zhuang"]}]
