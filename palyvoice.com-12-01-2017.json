Senior midfielder Marcel Colchen gained possession of the ball and quickly passed it to fellow senior midfielder Yahli Malchin, who proceeded to barely miss a strong shot over the left corner of the goal.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are still working on our offensive capabilities,\u201d senior Nicholas Camarena said. \u201cWe have a few players who are good offensively who are injured right now and when they get back, we should be looking at scoring some more goals.\u201d\r\n\r\nAfter losing their first league game against Los Altos High School last week, 4-2, the Vikings stepped up their defensive game, never letting the ball stay on their side too long.\r\n\r\nSenior goalkeeper Michel Ange Siaba played a key role for the Vikings' defensive squad, shutting out the Mountain View offensive with a couple impressive saves, including a first half corner kick that hit the side post before ricocheting into Siaba's arms. He also made a close save in the final minutes in the game, stopping the Spartans' last attempt to win the game.\r\n\r\nDespite a rocky start to the season, Camarena is still optimistic about the team\u2019s chances at winning Central Coast Sections playoffs.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think we will start improving once a lot of players start coming back from injuries,\u201d Camarena said. \u201cWe are still hoping to get a positive record for our wins and losses.

Especially sloppy play from the Vikings during the end of the 3rd quarter and beginning of the 4th quarter allowed the Eagles to cut its deficit from 23 points to 11 points with five minutes to play.\r\n\r\nThe Vikings' tenacious full-court pressure in the final minutes of the game shattered any comeback hopes for the Eagles.\r\n\r\nLuckily, the opportunities Paly lost\u00a0from careless turnovers were recovered by relentless pressure on their opponent, gifting them countless uncontested layups.\r\n\r\nThe Vikings and Eagles traded baskets early, and Los Altos led 20-19 after the 1st quarter. In the second quarter, Paly completely shut down the Los Altos offense, which scored a meager four points, while the Vikings took an 11-point lead into the half, 35-24, and preserved the advantage to the final buzzer.\r\n\r\nJunior forward Max Dorward thought the team played with great energy.\r\n\r\n\"We came out stronger than we normally do on Tuesday nights,\" Dorward said. \"We usually come out slower on Tuesday and so we came into this game thinking 'We need to come out strong,' and that's what we did.\"\r\n\r\nDorward led the Vikings with 24 points, eight rebounds, five assists and three steals, and junior forward Will Schlemmer added nine points, four assists, four steals and three rebounds.\r\n\r\nAccording to head Coach Peter Diepenbrock, the team runs a significantly faster offense this year.\r\n\r\n\"We are playing with a style that fits our talent and skill level, much more than it did last year,\" Diepenbrock said. \"We definitely have a team that is much better at running, pressing and looking for open court possibilities.\"\r\n\r\nThe Vikings are preparing for their next De Anza League matchup at Wilcox High School (7-6, 2-0) this Friday at 7:45 p.m.","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School boys' basketball team (11-2, 3-0) continued its winning streak last night, breezing by its De Anza League foe the Los Altos Eagles (7-6, 0-2), 63-50 Tuesday night at Gunn High School.","date":"2017-01-11 17:39:40","author":"Benner Mullin","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/IMG_4927.jpg","categories":["Basketball","Sports","Spotlight","Uncategorized"],"tags":["basketball","de anza league","los altos","max dorward","palo alto basketball","palo alto boys basketball","paly","paly basketball","Peter Diepenbrock","will schlemmer"]},{"id":127823,"title":"Teachers propose 16 new courses for following year","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2017\/01\/11\/teachers-propose-16-new-courses-for-following-year\/","content":"<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Teachers are hoping to have their courses approved for next school year after 16 new course proposals were presented to the Palo Alto Unified School District Board of Education Tuesday night in the district office. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chief Academic Officer Sharon Ofek spoke on behalf of the teachers present to provide quick summations of each course. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe thank the staff from both high schools to step out of their comfort zones and to create new courses,\u201d Ofek said. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most of the focus of new classes was directed towards potential yoga and calculus classes.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019ve heard from many students that the fact there is no course between IAC and AB Calculus, which is frustrating since that AB is the least challenging class they can take and yet they are still struggling,\u201d Paly Associated Student Body School Board Representative David Tayeri said.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The current Yoga class offered at Paly, available to 10th graders only, has seen a rise in popularity due to the push to increase social and emotional wellness at Paly. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cTo support the social emotional needs of the students that students are getting in their normal physical education, \u201d Paly Physical Education teacher Sheri Mulroe said.

While he may play classical for theater's production of The Importance of Being Earnest, or come up with zany beats as his character, jNitz, Kienitz is found listening to different music than he plays in public.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThis week, The Paly Voice sat down with senior rapper Jackson Kienitz to discuss his musical inspirations.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Palo Alto High School senior Jackson Kienitz, is a part-time student, part-time rapper, known around campus for his satirical persona as the vain and self-important artist jNitz. For this installment of Tuesday Tunes, the Paly Voice will not be talking to this humorous caricature, but to the real Kienitz, to find out what music he plays when he isn\u2019t performing on a stage.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Kienitz, music was something he and his dad always shared, exchanging discoveries between each other as they blasted songs throughout the house.\u00a0Kienitz's dad got the ball rolling by introducing him to some of his first artists. Little did he know that the enthusiasm he instilled in him would manifest itself into Kienitz's\u00a0own artist, years later.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWhen I was a youngster, we'd listen to his various albums everyday on the way to school, whether it be John Mayer, Lenny Kravitz, Kanye West, KT Tunstal or something else,\u201d Kienitz said. \u201cAs I've grown older and started to discover artists and songs on my own, the roles have almost reversed.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kienitz explained how his taste evolved over the years, as what he would listen to on his own permuted periodically, expanding his range of exposure.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIn elementary school, I wasn't actively searching for music, but my iPod consisted of Jackson 5, Queen, Weird Al Yankovic, a random song from The Simpson's and so on,\u201d Kienitz said.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kienitz didn\u2019t \u00a0purposefully start exploring new musicians until middle school, when his tastes diverged into newer genres, but mainly consisted of alternative artists like The Black Keys, White Stripes and Gary Clark Jr. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cCurrently I'm listening to a lot of R&amp;B, Funk, and Hip-Hop but also Folk and of course, \u00a0Post-Neo-Modernist-Contemporary,\u201d Kienitz said, the last being a playful jab at the pretentious style expressed by his alternative alias.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kienitz shared that his favorite artists include Kendrick Lamar, Frank Ocean, Vulfpeck, Jake Bugg and James Blake.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To show a sample size of what you can find Kienitz listening to, The Paly Voice has consolidated a Top 15 list since there are too many favorites to scale down to ten.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/embed.spotify.com\/?uri=spotify%3Auser%3Ajwylder%3Aplaylist%3A3W3cYVv9BwogKmRJWRHhNl\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"This week, The Paly Voice sat down with senior rapper Jackson Kienitz to discuss his musical inspirations.","date":"2017-01-10 19:58:00","author":"Donnesh Farmanfarmaian","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/15133829_1081432702002865_527032860_o.jpg","categories":["A&amp;E Section Spotlight","Tuesday Tunes"],"tags":["entertainment","jackson kienitz","jNitz","music","Tuesday Tunes"]},{"id":127784,"title":"Paly debater wins out-of-state tournament","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2017\/01\/10\/paly-debater-wins-out-of-state-tournament\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_127816\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/DSC_0076.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-127816\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/DSC_0076.jpg\" alt=\"Palo Alto High School junior debater Frances Zhuang poses in front of the Media Arts Center on Tuesday.

This put me in great spirits and contributed to my in-round confidence and poise.\u201d\r\n\r\nZhuang \u00a0argued on the topic of freedom of speech on college campus.\r\n\r\n\"I did a lot more research about the topic this time and I found a bunch of really good arguments in favor of restricting certain kinds of free speech that people weren't expecting, and a lot of reasons why hate speech codes are good,\" Zhuang said. \"The skills I acquired from the last few years of debate helped me become a faster speaker and a more flexible thinker.\u201d\r\n\r\nJunior debater Barry He and senior debater Colin Fee finished as quarterfinalists in the tournament, according to club president senior Ethan Teo. Teo says Paly was additionally awarded four \u201cspeaker awards,\u201d presented to debaters with high average points given for quality of debate strategy and speaking skills in the preliminary rounds of the competition. Paly was awarded 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th places for Zhuang, He, Teo and Fee, respectively.\r\n\r\nAccording to Teo, the Vikings\u2019 performance this weekend was well-deserved.\r\n\r\n\u201cOur team did a phenomenal job this weekend, but I definitely saw it coming,\u201d Teo said. \u201cFrances, Barry and Colin have worked extremely hard on debate, especially this past year, so it's really great to see them perform well at tournaments.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe tournament in Tacoma this weekend is a step towards the Tournament of Champions, the \"World Cup\" of high school debate, according to Zhuang. Zhuang received a bid for the Tournament of Champions because of her performance at this weekend\u2019s competition, placing her halfway to being able to attend the TOC, <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/12\/13\/students-halfway-to-qualifying-for-tournament-of-champions-debate\/\">just like teammates Fee and He<\/a>.\r\n\r\n\u201cI got what we call a 'bid to the TOC' at UPS [University of Puget Sound tournament],\u201d Zhuang said. \u201cThe TOC is the ultimate debate tournament where the best debaters in the country get to compete, and a bid means you're halfway there. Debaters usually need two bids to qualify. Looking forward, my goals are to get another bid to the TOC, to get better at a wider variety of arguments, and to do well at future tournaments.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Teo, the team will compete next weekend in Los Angeles on its next step towards the TOC.","excerpt":"Palo Alto High School Speech and Debate team member junior Frances Zhuang placed first in the Lincoln-Douglas Open Division at the 83rd Annual Puget Sound High School Tournament this weekend in Tacoma, Washington.","date":"2017-01-10 10:37:58","author":"Emma van der Veen","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/DSC_0076.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":["debate","Fee","He","los angeles","palo alto high school","puget sound","speech and debate","tacoma","teo","toc","tournament","Tournament of Champions","University","Washington","zhuang"]},{"id":127720,"title":"Girls&#8217; basketball maintains hot streak against Gunn","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2017\/01\/08\/girls-basketball-maintains-hot-streak-against-gunn\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_127736\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"391\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/IMG_8103.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-127736\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/IMG_8103.jpg\" alt=\"skylar burris does basketball\" width=\"391\" height=\"261\" \/><\/a> Senior forward Skylar Burris passes the ball to the top of the key against rival Gunn Titans (7-6, 1-1). \u00a0Photo by: Noah Yuen[\/caption]\r\n\r\n\"If you want to win, box out!\" Palo Alto High School girls' basketball (8-2, 2-0) head coach Scott Peters said to his team late in the fourth quarter of a De Anza League matchup against cross-town rivals Gunn High School (7-6, 1-1).

Paly\u00a0was able to counter its\u00a0carelessness with the ball by playing stingy defense and shutting\u00a0the Titans down on offense.\r\n\r\nThe Vikings took an early 19-6 lead after four minutes of play\u00a0in the first quarter and never took their feet off the gas pedal. At the half, the Vikings led 47-29 and continued to pummel the under-sized Titan squad throughout the remainder of the game.\r\n\r\nJunior shooting guard Spencer Rojahn, who recorded eight points along with six rebounds for the Vikings, said the\u00a0win is a great sign for the team moving forward.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis big win gives us confidence going into the season, but we need to be able to handle success and continue to work hard in practice,\u201d Rojahn said.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_127732\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"311\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/Bryant.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-127732\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/Bryant.jpg\" alt=\"Junior center Bryant Jefferson attempts a free-throw late in the game against Gunn on Friday.

Dorward led the Vikings with 20 points, seven rebounds, three assists and two steals, including 10 points in the first quarter. Senior guard Miles Tention chipped in with 10 points, four assists, three rebounds and three steals. Exceptional ball movement enabled\u00a013 of \u00a0Paly\u2019s 14 roster players to score either from the field or the free-throw line during the game.\r\n\r\nDorward said he was impressed by the significant win margin, but the Vikings still have aspects of their game to study and work on.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe played well and I thought we exceeded our expectations, but we have to continue to improve,\u201d Dorward said. \u201cWe will look at film to see what we have to work on, but we definitely have to cut down on our turnovers.\u201d\r\n\r\nPaly held its ground defensively, limiting Gunn\u2019s star player, senior Jeffrey Lee-Heidenreich to 11 points. Lee-Heidenrich was the Titans\u2019 leading scorer heading into Friday's matchup.\r\n\r\nThe Vikings hope to continue their undefeated De Anza League\u00a0season against the Los Altos High School Eagles (7-5, 0-1) on Tuesday at Gunn High School.\r\n\r\n","excerpt":"Friday night was a decided victory for the Palo Alto High School boys\u2019 basketball team (10-2, 2-0), which dominated throughout the game against cross-town rivals, the Gunn Titans (9-4, 0-2), with an end score of 80-50.","date":"2017-01-08 12:47:37","author":"Benner Mullin","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/spenc.jpg","categories":["Basketball","Sports","Spotlight","Uncategorized"],"tags":["basketball","dorward","gunn","palo alto","paly","recap","Rojahn","tention","titans","vikings"]},{"id":127677,"title":"Preview: Girls&#8217; basketball aims to continue undefeated league play against Gunn","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2017\/01\/06\/preview-girls-basketball-aims-to-continue-undefeated-league-play-against-gunn\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_127667\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"560\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/DSC_0158.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-127667\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/DSC_0158.jpg\" alt=\"Senior forward Skylar Burris attacks the hoop against the Saratoga Falcons. &quot;&quot;, Burris said, as the Vikings went on to win the game, 81-46.
