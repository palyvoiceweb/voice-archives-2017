The Vikings utilized their height advantage over the Titans to run cash in for easy points in the paint. In addition, they moved the ball early, leading to countless uncontested jumpers and a flurry of scoring to open the game.\r\n\r\nAlthough mostly disciplined and composed, the Vikings continue to struggle with careless turnovers. Coach Peter Diepenbrock was visibly upset after strings of unforced turnovers from the team.

Administrators installed 10 new surveillance cameras\u00a0throughout Palo Alto High School over the summer break. Placed in \u00a0locations around major buildings and bike racks, the additional security is intended to reduce theft and vandalism, according to school administration. Photo by Sid Sharma.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Assistant Principal Jerry Berkson makes it part of his relatively new routine to check security camera footage whenever bike thefts are reported. Berkson, who until recently had limited tools to effectively catch perpetrators at Palo Alto High School, has proven to be considerably successful at identifying theft incidents on campus with the aid of ten new surveillance cameras. The footage has been visited five\u00a0times as of October, and has\u00a0helped successfully identify the perpetrators in three of the incidents, Berkson said.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Despite their proven merit at catching thieves and school vandals, the use of these monitor devices brings up the question: Is what some see as the act of recording over 2,000 students and over 200 faculty members without clear student or board consent justified by the benefit of being able to prevent crime on campus?<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Berkson, the new cameras were originally installed to deter bike theft. The cameras were installed either near bike racks, to record the theft, or around a number of the campus's access points where the footage would show thieves entering or exiting the scene of the crime. According to Berkson, between the original conception of the idea to install cameras and the actual installation, the purpose of the cameras seemed to have changed. As several incidents of vandalism and campus streaking occurred with the new year, the devices proved\u00a0to have other helpful purposes besides catching bike thieves.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/iframewidth=800height=618src=\/\/www.thinglink.com\/card\/835716532049805314type=text\/htmlframeborder=0webkitallowfullscreenmozallowfullscreenallowfullscreenscrolling=no\/iframe\"><iframe src=\"\/\/www.thinglink.com\/card\/835716532049805314\" width=\"800\" height=\"618\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/a><i>This map illustrates the location of the newly installed security cameras on campus. These do not include the cameras in the Media Arts Center\u00a0<\/i>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Paly Voice counted that four of the 10 newly installed cameras are pointed at bike racks. The other six are generally pointed at popular student areas or outside the range of the bike racks, including in\u00a0the Quad, and the\u00a0large tree adjacent to the math building.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not all bike racks have coverage either. The uncovered areas include the football field bike racks and the science building racks.<\/span>\r\n\r\nAccording to campus supervisor Scott Reese, who has served the school for over 20 years, most bike thefts occur after school. A good thief may be equipped with an arsenal of advanced tools from bolt cutters to freon gas,\u00a0a refrigerant used in air conditioning which freezes a sprayed-on surface in a matter of seconds, making frozen locks extremely brittle. For the best of these sinister specialists, it only takes 90 seconds or less to steal a bike, according to Reese.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When The Paly Voice got access to some of the footage, courtesy of Berkson, as viewed at midnight, much of the it was\u00a0simply impossible to comprehend, some was very visible, but some was\u00a0occasionally too obscured by light glare to identify the perpetrator. \u201cIt's not the greatest quality of footage,\" Berkson said, explaining how the nighttime nature of most of these crimes creates one of the chief obstacles for the administration. \u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to School Board member Heidi Emberling, the next-most-recent round of school board-approved cameras was installed a few years ago with the specific purpose of catching locker thieves .\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\nSchool Board member Camille Townsend was not necessarily supportive\u00a0of the newly added cameras.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe weren\u2019t made aware of that [the cameras], \" Townsend said. \"For me, I\u2019m not in support of surveillance unless there is a very specific purpose like, for example, straight on the lockers to dissuade locker theft.\u201d\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ken Dauber, another school board member, said\u00a0the cameras were well within the administration\u2019s rights.<\/span>\r\n\r\n\"I think they [the surveillance cameras] fall into the scope of what the principal is allowed to decide,\" Dauber said. \"I don't think the principal should have to come to the school board for approval.\"\r\n\r\nEthics experts generally encourage schools to follow a set of guidelines when camera installation is involved.

Steketee has written a number of ethical guidelines for District Administration Magazine.\r\n\r\n\"Develop policies that set out the purpose for using surveillance cameras and outline the parameters for use,\" Skeketee stated in one of her articles. \"Notify the school community-by including statements in student handbooks and posting signs-that surveillance cameras are located throughout school buildings and that anyone on school property may be videotaped.\"\r\n\r\nIn line with\u00a0this recommendation, the Paly administration has framed several notices throughout the school, informing\u00a0passersby that cameras are watching them.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_127414\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"800\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/IMG_8394.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-127414\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/IMG_8394.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_8394\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" \/><\/a> \"All Activities Monitored By Video Camera\" reads one of 7\u00a0notice signs, placed on a pillar near the auto shop bike racks, in approximate distance to one of the ten cameras. These signs were added after the cameras went online, to abide by ethical regulations as per suggestion of the District Administration Magazine.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nSurrounding school districts also abide by these same sets of rules.\r\n\r\nFor example, Mountain View High School publishes signs on the campus and a warning in its\u00a0student handbook. The handbook reads: \"Surveillance cameras are in place in numerous areas on school property. Their purpose is for the protection of students, staff and property. Information obtained from camera recordings may be used in the investigation of school rule violations or criminal activity.\"\r\n\r\nAs for Steketee's suggestion to include statements in the school handbook, there is no mention of the cameras in the 86-page Paly student handbook this year, and no parent or student consent, nor board approval, was received for the devices at the time of installation according to Emberling and Townsend.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The footage that is not filmed in the MAC is easily accessible by administrators on their laptops, phones, or tablets through the Alibi interface. The MAC footage is stored on the DVR in the control room of the MAC. <\/span>\r\n\r\nAccording to students on the robotics team, last year, students were able to get access to the wood shop camera footage because the administration linked a live stream of the camera footage on one of the district's public websites. The link has since been removed.\r\n\r\n\"Some people I know found a way to access a camera around the wood shop online,\" senior Gregory Jerian said. They were able to take snapshots of what was going on around the bike cages in front of the science building.\"\r\n\r\nThe installation of the cameras did not affect the insurance rate of the school, according to Berkson. Often insurance companies will offer lower rates if their client installs cameras. The rationale is that fewer things will be stolen, meaning the insurance company will have to pay less in possible damages.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The installation is indicative of a larger trend of increased surveillance in schools. A 2008-9 Justice Department report found that use of security cameras in public schools was nearly 50 percent nationwide, while according to a report by the National Center for Education Statistics camera surveillance in public schools rose to 89 percent by the 2013-2014 school year.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\nThe Fourth Amendment, which usually protects people from unlawful search and seizure, does not uniformly apply to students at school. Courts have upheld surveillance in public areas\u00a0and suspicion-less searches such as drug tests constitutional.\r\n\r\nAfter several months of being in active use, the cameras have been proven effective at catching bike theft and vandalism incidents. Yet according to Reese, the number of thefts this year has stayed consistent with last year when cameras were not installed.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"Several new small, inconspicuous cameras have come online in the past few weeks to help the Palo Alto High School administration patrol the campus.\r\n\r\n","date":"2016-12-15 18:34:46","author":"Donnesh Farmanfarmaian","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/IMG_0062.jpg","categories":["News"],"tags":["administration","cameras","campus","media arts center","palo alto high school","school safety","security","student"]},{"id":127406,"title":"Stage tech: The unseen side of theater","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/12\/14\/stage-tech-the-unseen-side-of-theater\/","content":"<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bright lights, dazzling costumes and vivid sets, part of every theater production, are essential in transporting audiences to other worlds in which dramatic stories, played out by Palo Alto High School\u2019s talented actors and actresses, can seem life-like. But, behind the scenes, students dressed in all black are busy making the whole production possible, and without them, the show would not go on.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These students are members of Paly\u2019s stage tech program, which handles everything from lighting to costumes to sets, according to senior Edward Park.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWhat stage tech, or stage crew, does in the shows is anything that isn\u2019t just the actors on stage,\u201d Park said. \u201cAll the audio things [...], all the props, that\u2019s stuff that our class puts together to supplement the actors doing their show.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While this is Park\u2019s fourth year working with stage tech at Paly, he has been working behind the scenes for much longer.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI started doing tech in 6th grade with Ms. Gray at Jordan,\u201d Park said. \u201cAnd then as time went on I came to Paly and I did tech here, and I\u2019ve also been working productions outside of school at community theaters in the Bay Area.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once Park came to Paly, he joined the eighth period stage tech class. The majority of students involved in Paly stage tech are also a part of this once-per-week class.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt [the class] is Mondays after school for two hours, and that\u2019s the only time we meet,\u201d Park said. \u201cThe only real requirement in it is that you work at least 75 hours a semester, which is easy enough if you run a show, come to every class, and come to a couple of the work days.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once a part of the program, a student is faced with the many fields of stage tech, including sound, light, set building, props, hair, makeup, costumes and more. With so many options to chose from, many try multiple fields until they find their main focus, while others know from the beginning.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThere are definitely people like me who focus on one thing; I\u2019ve been focusing on sound since I was a freshman,\u201d Park said. \u201cThere are some people who work in multiple fields, like there are a couple of sophomores and freshmen who work in sound and lights and set, and a couple of people do hair, makeup and costuming as well as some sound work or some crew work here and there.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After a couple years of getting a feel for the vast variety offered by stage tech, students are encouraged to hone in one skill.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe do recommend that eventually, by junior year, you do choose one thing to focus on, so that you can get proficient at it and start teaching the incoming class of underclassmen,\u201d Park said. \u201cBut overall, if you really want to be a jack of all trades, that\u2019s entirely fine.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\nPark has focused on\u00a0sound since his freshman year, and is currently the head of the sound group.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat I do in stage tech right now is I supervise the microphone and the audio work of every actor and stage technician that there is,\u201d Park said.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Park, his favorite part of the stage tech program is the close-knit bond between the stage crew and the actors.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI never did any of the sports programs, I\u2019m a part of the music program,\u201d Park said. \u201cBut the community I get from stage tech is great because not only am I working with the crew, I\u2019m working with the actors.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Park prioritizes audio work, junior Gail Hildebrand has focused on props since her sophomore year.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI became props master when the previous props master, Charlotte Moffat [...] was a senior my sophomore year, I took over for her for a couple of the shows,\u201d Hildebrand said.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hildebrand acquires props for a show by borrowing, renting or even reusing old props, but she prefers creating the props herself.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI would probably choose to be \u2018props designer\u2019 more than \u2018props master\u2019, because that\u2019s more the creation of things,\u201d Hildebrand said.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hildebrand looks forward to the production of \"Beauty and the Beast\", because she will have the chance to get creative and incorporate elements of props that she enjoys.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI\u2019m hoping I\u2019ll be able to help with a lot of the props for that \"Beauty and the Beast\" because they\u2019ll be more old-timey themed and that\u2019s the stuff that I like,\u201d Hildebrand said.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Hildebrand, her favorite part of working on props is seeing the final product on stage at a show. \u201cIt\u2019s really cool to see everyone\u2019s creative ideas and how they all come together,\u201d Hildebrand said. \u201cEveryone has their own, unique ideas, but when you put them all together it makes a consistent, really cool show.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to props, Hildebrand does set building. While her experiences in the two fields have been different, they complement each other other well. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cBuild is really nice because it\u2019s very informal,\u201d Hildebrand said. \u201cAt least to me, you just sort of show up, and they just hand you tools and explain how to use them. I went into it not even knowing how to use a drill, and now I feel confident using jigsaws. That is definitely an improvement for me, and I think it helps with props as well, because I know how to build stuff, if I need to.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hildebrand has found that the transition from the Haymarket theater to the newly constructed Performing Arts Center has caused some changes in set building.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cNow that we have the new theater, we have to have [to build] much larger sets,\u201d Hildebrand said.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After working in the Haymarket theater for three years, Park has also had to readjust to the different equipment in the PAC.\u00a0<\/span>According to Park, the biggest difference between the Haymarket and the PAC is the new state of the art equipment.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThere are a lot of issues at the Haymarket that come just from age,\u201d Park said. \u201cA lot of cabling as well as the hardware that we have is so old that we\u2019re gonna have problems no matter what we try and fix it. And of course we try and fix it, like all the white noise and all the stage issues that we had. We have always tried to fix that. That isn\u2019t an issue with this theater and all the hardware that we have. What we\u2019re working with is new, so we know there aren\u2019t any developmental faults with it. And we\u2019ve learned how to use it better.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Park encourages those interested to join the program and participate in the unique experience that stage tech has to offer. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe Paly stage tech program, or the Paly theater program as a whole, is probably one of the most professional high school programs that you can come and work with. [...]\u201d Park said. \u00a0\u201cThat being said, that does mean that we\u2019re a slightly more serious environment than some other high school programs and I can see how that might be a bit frightening to some people who\u2019ve never experienced or done this kind of thing before. But regardless of how intense we are, we\u2019re always inclusive of new people and if you\u2019re coming in ready to learn, that\u2019s all we need.\u201d<\/span>","excerpt":"The bright lights, dazzling costumes, and vivid sets part of every theater production are essential in transporting captivated audiences to other worlds in which dramatic stories, played out by Palo Alto High School\u2019s talented actors and actresses, can seem life-like.

This recently brought them to the Alta tournament in Utah, where both students received \u201cbids\u201d that bring\u00a0them one step closer to a coveted spot in the TOC, a tournament that, according to He, only roughly 100 student debaters participate in. Students receive bids based on their performances in previous tournaments, many of which are out of the area and even out of state. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both students performed exceptionally well in their previous tournament, which Fee credits to their personal connection to their topics.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThis debate tournament went pretty well,\u00a0since we both went pretty far,\u201d Fee said. \u201cBut more importantly was both of us writing about ourselves.
