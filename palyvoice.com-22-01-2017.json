The school year start and end dates, as well as various local holidays, have not yet been finalized.<\/span>\r\n\r\n\"We fully expect the student start dates for 2017-2018 to be similar to 2016-2017 (that is, Monday 8\/14\/17 for HS and Tuesday, 8\/15\/17 for K-8),\" the PAUSD <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pausd.org\/teaching-learning\/school-year-calendars\">website reads<\/a>.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The calendar committee consists of teachers and administration who gather to discuss potential calendar schedules and submit a\u00a0recommendation to the Board of Education. Typically, the committee discusses the calendar schedule in three-year increments, then presents the proposal to the\u00a0board.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe committee's recommendation usually goes back to the bargaining teams for review and final agreement before it is presented to the board,\u201d Bowers said. \u201cThe committee has done its work and now the negotiating teams are talking about the proposals.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Bowers, the calendar will be finalized at the upcoming school board meeting.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the calendar will be confirmed later than usual, students are unable to plan their vacations for next school year without the possibility of missing school.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cFor people who take vacations and especially for people who are trying to plan their summers now, it\u2019s hard because you don\u2019t know when you are going to be back and whether you need to miss school,\u201d junior Sarah Brodbeck said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll necessarily be affected, but I know friends that definitely would be if they didn\u2019t know what days they had to be at school.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paly staff are also experiencing issues in planning their yearly schedules.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt is a little frustrating to not know what is going to happen next year this late in the school year,\u201d librarian Rachel Kellerman said. \u201cI hope they [the committee] are taking the input from past calendars to put together a really good calendar. I\u2019m hoping the product will be worth the wait.\"<\/span>","excerpt":"Palo Alto Unified School District students and staff are currently unable to solidify their mid-year vacation plans for the 2017-18 school year due to delays caused by unforeseen adjustments to next school year's calendar.

Along with this loss, Paly lost nail-biting games to Pinewood High School (13-2, 2-0) and Castro Valley High School (13-3, 3-0), by two points and five points, respectively.\r\n\r\nRigorous games like these have prepared the Vikings for upcoming league matchups, according to senior forward Skylar Burris.\r\n\r\n\"Playing against teams that are as good as Saint Mary's and Pinewood forces us to recognize how hard we have to work to get to that level,\" Burris said. \"We can't drop to the level of the competition, and by playing against great teams it forces us to play great as well, setting a standard for even our least competitive game.\"\r\n\r\nHomestead is new to the De Anza League this year, as the team\u00a0moved up from the El Camino League after demolishing their competition with a 12-0 league record last season.

To secure a win in the upcoming game, the Vikings have prepared during practice by working on their weaknesses: defense and ball movement.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cSanta Clara is a pretty good team so this game will surely be a competitive one especially since it's a Santa Clara home game,\u201d Amanoni said. \u201cSince we struggled last game with a couple of defensive style plays, we worked on that. We were able to practice yesterday to fix passes and find more productive ways to get the ball forward.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After a hard fought loss versus Homestead High School last Thursday, senior forward Tess Preising stresses the importance of practicing the little things.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe need to make the simple plays,\u201d Preising said. \u201cLast game [versus Homestead] we were sloppy with our possessions and were constantly dribbling into trouble. If we make the simple passes and plays, we would be in a better position to score.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\nThe Vikings are also conscious\u00a0of their undefeated streak, and hope to extend the clean record, according to Preising.\r\n\r\n\"I am looking forward to keeping our undefeated streak and obviously scoring a lot of goals this game, but scoring them creatively,\" Preising said. \"Maybe by implementing the plays we've been working on in practice or getting some off a good counter attack.\"\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amanoni expressed a mild concern for the game against Santa Clara regarding its under groomed soccer field.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cSanta Clara has poor playing field conditions that over the years made it difficult to get good results,\u201d\u00a0Amanoni said. \u201cPlaying every team, we notice that we can never look at a game as an easy win; it ends up making us always play our worst. However, Santa Clara will for sure be a good match.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\nPreising revealed\u00a0a similar view on preparing for the game.\r\n\r\n\"I think this game will be neither easy nor hard, since we've done well against Santa Clara before but I don't think we should have any expectations of what the game could be like,\" Preising said. \"It's a new year and they (Bruins) have new players, we have new players, so it really all comes down to whether we will show a good performance on the field or not today.\"","excerpt":"Aside from one tie, the Palo Alto girls\u2019 soccer team (8-0-1, 2-0-1) is on a blazing path of victories this season.

Instead, the new guidance offices will occupy this space.\u00a0Drawing: DLM Architects.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Palo Alto High School students will enjoy access to yet another state-of-the-art facility in two years, as the highly-anticipated library renovation project is scheduled to commence this summer, according to librarian Rachel Kellerman.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kellerman said the \u201cbest case scenario\u201d is that the library will be completed by the 2018-2019 winter.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new library will feature a task-lit silent study room, which will facilitate focused work, and a makerspace, a \"flexible\" room\u00a0that may include 3-D printers, according to Kellerman. <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/09\/08\/school-seeks-to-pilot-new-technology-policy\/\">Since all students will have Google Chromebooks<\/a>\u00a0by the time the project will be complete, the computer lab area will be smaller than before. There will also be an enclosed instructional area, designated collaboration rooms for small groups and a staff operation room, among other additions. The south end of the building will house the guidance offices as well as the College and Career Center, according to Kellerman.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New furniture, such as updated high counter seating areas and book displays made to look similar to those at bookstores, will also be installed.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWhat we endeavor to do is think about how students work and how we can accommodate them,\u201d Kellerman said.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Kellerman, the construction crew will demolish the inside of the library during the renovation process and the provisional library will reside in the Student Center, with the adjacent portables (P3 and P5) serving as temporary storage rooms for books.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt\u2019s not ideal, but this way we\u2019ll keep our books safe and secure,\u201d Kellerman said.<\/span>\r\n\r\nThe relocations of other rooms affected by the project are still tentative, according to Assistant Principal Jerry Berkson. As of now, the teacher copy room and ARC will move to the 400s building, the computer lab and ASB to the portables, and the English and World Languages teacher offices to the 300s building, he said.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the meantime, the library staff will encourage\u00a0students to use the digital library resources, and Kellerman will also be visiting classes for instructional lessons.<\/span>\r\n\r\nAccording to Kellerman, the Strong Schools Bond Initiative \u2013 a privately-funded organization that has financed all of Paly's latest renovations except for the gym \u2013 will provide the money for the library project. Kellerman, however, doesn't know the cost at the moment, as the project has not yet been bid.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sophomore Nisha McNealis is a frequent user of the library and, although disappointed about the timing, is looking forward to eventually gaining access to the new\u00a0facility.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cEven though I'd obviously rather have it done earlier, I think that the new improvements are important enough that I'm okay with waiting for a while and only having access to the complete library for a semester,\u201d McNealis said.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of the new features are going to be especially practical, she said.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe collaboration rooms will be really useful since I'm in debate and my teammates and I sometimes have practice rounds in the library,\" McNealis said. \"But it's really loud and hard to focus with everyone else in the library.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kellerman, too, is thrilled about the renovation project.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt\u2019ll definitely be a sacrifice for all, but it\u2019s so worth it,\u201d Kellerman said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be really awesome and we\u2019re really excited about it.\u201d<\/span>","excerpt":"Palo Alto High School students will enjoy access to yet another state-of-the-art facility in two years, as the highly-anticipated library renovation project is scheduled to commence this summer, according to librarian Rachel Kellerman.","date":"2017-01-17 09:42:47","author":"Jevan Yu","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/0000\/00\/library.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":["Berkson","construction","Kellerman","Library","renovation"]},{"id":128068,"title":"Thursday, Jan. 19 is the last day to add a class","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2017\/01\/17\/thursday-jan-19-is-the-last-day-to-add-a-class\/","content":"","excerpt":"","date":"2017-01-17 08:51:27","author":"Chirag Akella","categories":["Ticker"],"tags":[]},{"id":127819,"title":"ASB premieres Throwback Dance","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2017\/01\/16\/asb-premieres-throwback-dance\/","content":"<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students will soon gather to hear the songs of their middle school days such as Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cHalo\u201d and Taio Cruz\u2019s \u201cDynamite\u201d at the second Palo Alto High School dance of the 2016-17 school year.
