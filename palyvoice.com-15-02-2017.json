Photo by: David Hickey[\/caption]\r\n\r\nDuring the 2016 off-season, the Paly boys' basketball team (19-3, 10-0) acquired five-foot-10-inch junior shooting guard Jared Wulbrun, who had just moved from Birmingham, Alabama.\u00a0Wulbrun scored 24 points in his first regular season game as a Viking, hitting six of seven three-point shots and six of seven shots from the free-throw line. Wulbrun's sharpshooting along with his court vision and high basketball IQ, will be essential as the Vikings finish out league play this week.\r\n\r\nThe\u00a0Wulbrun\u00a0family\u00a0ventured to the west coast because Jared's father, Jeff Wulbrun, accepted a job offer at Stanford University as the head assistant coach for the men's basketball team.\r\n\r\nBasketball has been a passion for Jared Wulbrun for as long as he can remember. Moving to Palo Alto, he had mixed emotions about having to assimilate to his current team.\r\n\r\n\"My first impressions were varied coming from a team that won a state title last year. I wasn't sure what the season would be like, honestly,\" Wulbrun said. \"It's always a hard thing to come into a new school, a new team, and expect everything to go smoothly. I was playing for a starting job which means you're going against others on the team for one or two spots, which can cause problems. For the most part there were no issues or hard feelings between any of us, which did nothing but help the team chemistry grow.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the preseason, Wulbrun first played with the team in an out-of-state tournament and quickly realized the strength that the team possesses.\r\n\r\n\"I soon figured out that we had something special with our group,\" Wulbrun said. \"I came [to Palo Alto]\u00a0this summer and was able to play with the team in their summer tournaments and in our second tournament in Reno, Nevada. I saw what we had the potential to accomplish this year.\"\r\n\r\nWulbrun credits senior captain and point-guard Miles Tention for making his transition smoother than he expected.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_129555\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"394\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/jared-3.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-129555\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/jared-3.jpg\" alt=\"Wulbrun launches a three-point shot against Oak Grove High School.

Photo by: David Hickey[\/caption]\r\n\r\n\"I always give credit to Miles [Tention]\u00a0for how he immediately looked for me in games and treated me like we had played together for years, even though it had only been a few weeks,\" Wulbrun said. \"That made me feel comfortable right away, making the transition easy.\"\r\n\r\nWulbrun made an immediate impact on the team, aiding the Vikings' championship in their first regular season tournament in Burlingame, which he believes set the mindset for the rest of the season.\r\n\r\n\"After [the Burlingame tournament], we all got the feeling like we could do some big things this year and so far we have, going 20-3,\" Wulbrun said. \"Everything gelled perfectly and we were playing at a very high level. My thought was that 'We\u00a0could only go up from here.'\"\r\n\r\nAccording to junior forward William Schlemmer, Wulbrun has had an impact on the team as a knock-down three-point shooter as well as a great friend.\r\n\r\n\"He's pretty much become family since I met him because he moved here over the summer and got a chance to get familiar with everyone else on the team and he's a great person to have around on and off the court,\" junior forward Will Schlemmer said. \"He's a good shooter and hustler so he's willing to do the little things to get the job done.\"\r\n\r\nHaving clinched the top seed in the De Anza League, the team looks to continue their dominance against its toughest and most anticipated league opponent of the season, the Los Gatos High School Wildcats (16-6, 6-4), who currently sit in second place in the league, at 7 p.m. on Tuesday at Gunn High School. The two teams met earlier in the season, with the Vikings dismissing their arch-rivals in an intense, 66-57, victory.\r\n\r\nDuring the his first taste of the Paly-Los Gatos feud, Wulbrun poured in 17-points, 12 of which came from beyond the arch. According to Wulbrun, he felt the intensity of the matchup and is keen to bring the heat on Tuesday.\r\n\r\n\"I've heard that at Paly, most people aren't very fond of [Los] Gatos,\" Wulbrun said. \"The first game showed that. We\u00a0need to come out on Tuesday with the same mindset that we did at their place a few weeks ago. It's also senior night, and I know we all want to send our four seniors out the right way:\u00a0at home with a huge [win] over a rival.\"\r\n\r\nTuesday's game is Paly's annual basketball \"Senior night,\" where seniors<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Tention, Jack Simison, Ethan Stern and Eelis Copeland will be honored.<\/span>\r\n\r\nFor Paly, the key to stopping the strong Los Gatos\u00a0squad is limiting the play of Wildcat six-foot-six-inch junior forward Dylan Belquist.\u00a0Belquist was named to the De Anza League first team last year as a sophomore and dunked over six-foot-five-inch tall Schlemmer for two of his 20 points the last time the two teams met.\r\n\r\n\"We\u00a0just need to play our game and make sure to not give them second chances on the offensive glass,\" Schlemmer said. \"As for Dylan we just want to play as a team and have someone besides him beat us. These next two [league] games are extremely important. One of our goals this year is to go undefeated in league and we are close to achieving that goal.\"","excerpt":"A good amount of the students attending Palo Alto High School have lived in or around the city of Palo Alto for most of, if not all, their lives.

According to former elementary school teacher Erika Papakipos, who was a part of the demonstration, the group's goal was to encourage community members to speak up against DeVos and other appointments of the Trump adminstration. \"We're trying to let people know that we're not alone and that people should get out here and fight the normalization of outrageous cabinet picks and appointments,\" Papakipos said. Photo: William Sallomi.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe Tuesday confirmation of Betsy DeVos as Secretary of Education unsettled the Palo Alto Unified School District superintendent, Paly\u00a0teachers and the wider PAUSD community, a concern that initially sparked\u00a0after her remarks during the Senate hearing.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DeVos, a billionaire who hails from the Michigan elite, is widely known for her advocacy for school choice, a policy that<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0offers financial incentive for students to attend K-12 schools outside of the public school system.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Supporters of DeVos argue that her anti-regulation philosophy will provide students and their families with more independence and therefore better options. On the other hand, her critics assert that her exclusive work with non-public schools and narrow focus on charter and religious schools disqualify her from the position.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PAUSD Supt. Max McGee says he is unsettled by\u00a0the negative outlook on public education DeVos has expressed throughout the confirmation process.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cMs. DeVos may be very intelligent and she\u2019s certainly very wealthy, but I think she has a lot to learn about public education and leadership,\u201d McGee said.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DeVos has remained consistent on one of her signature policies, privatizing public schools, which has drawn criticism from public school officials nationwide. According to McGee, transferring public education funds into the private sector would prove to be a dangerous move.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cAssuming that privatization is going to make a difference for our most needy and, in many cases, our most deserving students, is misinformed,\u201d McGee\u00a0said.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the most memorable moments of DeVos' Senate hearing came when Sen. Tim Kaine, a Democrat from Virginia, asked DeVos if she believed all schools that receive taxpayer funding \u2013 public, public charter and private \u2013 should be equally accountable, and <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.c-span.org\/video\/?c4648121\/tim-kaine-betsy-devos\">DeVos eventually replied \u201cwell, no<\/a>.\" In stark contrast,\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">McGee said that PAUSD will strive to be\u00a0a national model for accountability, and\u00a0hopes others will follow suit.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI think in her heart of hearts, Ms. DeVos understands the importance of accountability,\u201d McGee said. \u201cCertainly, business owners are accountable to their shareholders if they\u2019re going to stay in business, so I hope some of the things we do here in Palo Alto and other lighthouse districts across the country in terms of accountability could inform federal policy.\u201d <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Paly social science\u00a0teacher Caitlin Evans, DeVos\u2019 ideas\u00a0would undermine the current system. Diverting attention away from the struggles of public schools by providing the option of non-public schools would only worsen the current state of public schools, according to Evans.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThere will be a huge swath of the population that won\u2019t know they have the right to choose, or they don\u2019t have a school they can physically get to, so you end up with public schools that are underfunded,\u201d Evans said. \u201cThat\u2019s a concern that public school teachers have, that she [DeVos] is taking the emphasis away from public schools, and giving a buffet of options, and what that ultimately means is that those [public] schools get worse, because they lose funding, teachers and students.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Evans is not worried about the future of PAUSD, but she is worried about neighboring school districts that do not have the large amounts of funding that PAUSD has.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI\u2019m not too concerned about that issue in Palo Alto, but I know that the Oakland School District is really concerned about it,\u201d Evans\u00a0said, referencing the school choice policy. \u201cThey have a big population. They have a lot of charter schools and private schools and they are all competing for students. It puts the public schools in a really tight spot.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\nFor Duveneck Elementary School teacher Barbara Susco, DeVos severely lacks the experience to\u00a0control education at the federal level.\r\n\r\n\"She's not qualified to be the Education Secretary,\" Susco said. \"She has never handled a large budget and she has no experience with public schools.\"\r\n\r\nSusco, along with other community members, attended a protest\u00a0Monday afternoon\u00a0on the corner of El Camino Real and Embarcadero Rd. The group's goal was to inspire others to contact Republican senators and urge them to reconsider then-nominee DeVos, according to Susco.\r\n\r\nFormer Duveneck teacher Erika Papakipos joined Susco in participating in the demonstration. According to Papakipos, DeVos is dangerous and a threat to American education.\r\n\r\n\"I am concerned that having somebody that knows nothing about education and who has sort of an antipathy to public education is going to dismantle public education and further increase income inequality and opportunity inequality in this country,\" Papakipos said. \"I'm afraid that she [DeVos] would just move us in the wrong direction.\"\r\n\r\nPapakipos said she believes that the values and opinons of people in Palo Alto are threatened by DeVos's new role in the government, and that those who don't support her should make themselves heard.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paly senior Ibby Day has enjoyed her public school education and worries that school choice may negatively impact the diversity of public schools.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI think that attending public schools has opened me up to a more diverse range of people,\u201d Day said. \u201cI fear that DeVos' school choice plan might take away [some] types of people that attend public schools, which will cause the student population to be less diverse.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">McGee expressed an interest in working with DeVos by providing an example of a successful public education model.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI would love to have her join us in Palo Alto and see what a high quality education is like,\u201d McGee said. \u201cMaybe [we could] find ways [to] help inform policies that would have a positive impact on school districts across the country.\"<\/span>","excerpt":"The Tuesday confirmation of Betsy DeVos as Secretary of Education unsettled the Palo Alto Unified School District superintendent, Paly teachers and the wider PAUSD community, a concern that initially sparked after her remarks during the Senate hearing.","date":"2017-02-09 15:06:29","author":"Jevan Yu","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/SUSCO-4REAL1.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":["Betsy","cabinet","charter schools","confirmation","devos","education","evans","ibby day","max","McGee","Palo Alto Unified School District","public school","senate","united states"]},{"id":128922,"title":"Student groups vie for PAC accessibility","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2017\/02\/07\/student-groups-vie-for-pac-accessibility\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_129354\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"678\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/IMG_31222.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-129354\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/IMG_31222.jpg\" alt=\"performing arts center\" width=\"678\" height=\"509\" \/><\/a> The Performing Arts Center towers as one of Palo Alto High School's newest additions. Photo: Adrienne Kwok.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The newly-built Performing Arts Center is Palo Alto High School\u2019s newest landmark. With a grand total of 25,100 square feet that boasts a motorized orchestra pit and 582 seats, the PAC is a display of grandeur on Paly\u2019s campus. However, as of now, the PAC remains a closed-off resource that many Paly students find difficult to utilize.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since its <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/10\/04\/performing-arts-center-formally-introduced\/\">grand opening<\/a> in October 2016, the PAC has held theater, choir, band and orchestra performances. However, one group that has found difficulty in reserving the PAC is Paly's very own Team 8 Robotics group. With approximately 83 students, Paly Robotics is one of the largest student organizations found on campus.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clubs at Paly have the option to rent out spaces such as the Media Arts Center to use for events.\u00a0The<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0robotics team recently intended to use the PAC for their kickoff day, to mark the beginning of their 6-week \u201cbuild season\u201d during which team members build a robot for competition, and also for their awards night, according to Head Coach Christopher Kuszmaul.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe PAC is an extremely valuable educational resource,\u201d Kuszmaul said. \u201cIt is my duty to make use of educational resources that are at my disposal. The PAC very much has my attention because I feel an obligation to the taxpayers who pay for this resource and if I don\u2019t use it, I am neglecting my duty.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Robotics students, including senior project manager Jonathan Zwiebel, expressed similar concern.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe issue isn\u2019t that they charge money, the issue is that most students have never been in the PAC, ever,\u201d Zwiebel said. \u201cMost students aren\u2019t ever allowed to go into the PAC. You shouldn\u2019t spend money on a building then not use it because you don\u2019t want it to get dirty. It should be like the MAC or the MRC [Math Resource Center] or the library where there are just people in there because it\u2019s an open space.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Assistant Principal of Operations Jerry Berkson, the PAC\u2019s schedule is packed with events, partly due to Gunn High School\u2019s Spangenberg Theater which is currently undergoing renovation.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201c[The PAC] is booked a lot because right now we are sharing because Gunn\u2019s theater is under renovation,\u201d Berkson said. \u201cWe will eventually rent it out to outside parties. We\u2019re not going to do that for at least the first year, and probably beyond that. \u2026 We've got two plays from us per year, two plays per year for Gunn, all the choir events [and] all the instrumentals. There's so much going on that there is not a lot of space.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Robotics is not alone in its struggle to utilize Paly\u2019s resources. During the winter season, Paly\u2019s wrestling team requested to use the PAC.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We wanted to use the PAC because we currently don't have a gym to use for our dual meets,\u201d said wrestling coach Ryan Kessler. \u201cOur home competitions are all at Gunn High School. When I told my team it was a possibility we would be wrestling in there, they were pretty fired up. I mostly feel bad for our seniors Seth Goyal and Sara Aguilar who will miss out on the new gym that's being built. It would have been nice to send them off with a home match at Paly.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are four different categories used to determine the charges for renting a Palo Alto Unified School District facility. District and school-sponsored clubs and groups are allowed to rent all district facilities, with the exception of pools, at no charge. Departments of local governments, community organizations with 501c3 (nonprofit) status, and government agencies that are not charging fees are all required to pay a fee for rental. Businesses and religious organizations must pay a fee higher than that of the aforementioned groups. The charge for camps is per week rather than per hour.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The rental charge per hour is also dependent on the room or field one wishes to rent, with a greater charge for larger spaces.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A calendar delineating the PAC, Haymarket Theater and Gunn\u2019s Spangenberg Theater schedules may be found <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/spangenbergtheatre.org\/productioncalendar.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span>\r\n\r\nThe robotics team is looking forward to the PAC being available for more students to use.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Kuszmaul, \u201cthe PAC seems to be like the guest towels that nobody can use because we might make them dirty.\u201d<\/span>","excerpt":"The newly-built Performing Arts Center is Palo Alto High School\u2019s newest landmark.

Menlo-Atherton senior guard Eric Norton,\u00a0who scored a game-high 22 points, led the charge for the Bears and netted seven points in the second quarter.
