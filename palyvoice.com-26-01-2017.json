Students would also have a better-balanced life.\r\n\r\nAlong with the qualification that a student must play a sport not offered at Paly,\u00a0he or she must have played the sport for three\u00a0years prior to applying for Independent Study PE. The student must train year-round for a minimum of 15 hours a week, five to six days a week.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, simply meeting all these standards is not enough to get an Independent Study prep. One must also go through a rigorous application process. This\u00a0process needs to be easier for all students to apply in order to prevent any student from being deterred from applying. Sophomore Kat Merk has been riding horses since she was seven years old. She trains with her coach three to four hours a day, six to seven days a week. For her, the process of applying for Independent Study PE was long and difficult.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI was very surprised at how lengthy [the Independent Study PE application process] was because I feel like a signature from the coach would be enough,\" Merk said. \"I had to prove that I had been working with her for a certain amount of time, I had to pull out paperwork of contracts, I had to prove that I had been to competitions. It was a little bit too much.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students in tenth grade at Palo Alto Unified School District schools that have successfully completed ninth grade Physical Education have the option of applying for Independent Study Physical Education,\u00a0according to the Paly course catalog. A student in Independent Study PE is given a prep period for the entire year instead\u00a0of taking a PE class.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paly offers cross country, water polo, football, golf, girls' volleyball, basketball, soccer, wrestling, baseball, lacrosse, swimming and diving, badminton, softball, track as well as cheer and dance. Therefore, students participating in any of these sports are not eligible for Independent Study.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to PE teacher and Independent Study program head Peter Diepenbrock, there is a specific reason students in Paly sports are not eligible for an\u00a0Independent Study PE\u00a0prep.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u201c[The purpose of Independent Study PE] is to give students that have been involved in a sport for many years and have dedicated a good portion of their lives to their sport, an opportunity to continue that sport.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students [playing a Paly sport cannot get a prep] because if you play a Paly sport, you already have an opportunity to get a prep for it.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some may argue that this makes sense. However, sports seasons are only a few months long at most. Students that are dedicated to their sport devote hours of their time in the off-season to training. Anyone playing a sport at a high level has hours of practice a day and trains almost every day of the week. Students spend all this time to improve at their sport so that when they go back to their Paly team, the Paly team is stronger.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to PE teacher David Duran, the purpose of PE is to get exercise and socialize with peers. PE helps maintain physical health through exercise and mental health with socialization.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cOur philosophy is [that] we want you to come and learn a skill, learn some social skills, burn some calories,\" Duran said. \"PE, for the most part, is a very social class, so there is a lot of interaction, unlike some other classes. And for the long range, [our hope] is that you actually value exercise, and 50 years from now you are still active and exercising because there are benefits both for your body and mind to be physically fit,\u201d Duran said.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though I agree with the goals and intents of PE as outlined by Duran, students who already play sports do not need PE to achieve those goals. A student who does over 15 hours of exercise a week clearly understands the value of exercise. While practicing a sport, they learn new skills, socialize, and burn calories. If they are already fulfilling these PE goals, they gain no benefit from taking part in PE.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the Paly PE syllabus, the three standards for PE are to:<\/span>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cDemonstrate knowledge and competency in motor skills, movement patterns, and strategies needed to perform a variety of physical activities.\"<\/span><\/li>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"Achieve a level of physical fitness for health and performance while demonstrating knowledge of fitness concepts, principles, and strategies.\"<\/span><\/li>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"Demonstrate knowledge of psychological and sociological concepts, principles, and strategies as they apply to learning and performance of physical activity.\u201d<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through playing any sport, a student automatically engages in all of these standards.\u00a0Playing a sport with the dedication of 15 hours a week means that a student has competent motor skills and movement abilities. They are physically fit and understand fitness concepts as they apply to their specific sport, but also athletics in general. Through coaching, they learn how psychological and sociological concepts affect their sport. It is unfair to assume that a student participating in a non-Paly sport automatically fulfills these criteria if they fulfill the ones required for an Independent Study prep, but a student playing a Paly sport doesn\u2019t. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A critical reason why students should be given an Independent Study prep for any sport that takes 15 hours per week is because students need the time to work on homework and study. Students agree that this prep is vital to their ability to succeed in schoolwork. Students such as Merk agree.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201c[An Independent Study prep] gives you more time to focus on your academics and doesn\u2019t take away from your physical education because you\u2019re doing plenty after school,\u201d said Merk.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Playing a sport is a time-consuming activity. One must factor in not only the length of practice and competitions, but also time for activities\u00a0such as transport and showering. While students who play 15 hours of sports a week already struggle to fit all of this into their schedule, students without a prep find it even more difficult. Without time during their prep to meet with teachers, work on homework, or study, students may fall behind in their classes. In order to combat this, students have to stay up later at night to work on schoolwork. According to a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25028798\">study<\/a> conducted at the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Harvard-Westlake <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">School, getting less than eight hours of sleep a night is the biggest predictor of injury for high school athletes\u00a0and a quarter of athletes who are injured miss at least a week of playing time.<\/span>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_128278\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"511\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/Screen-Shot-2017-01-21-at-9.06.26-PM.png\"><img class=\" wp-image-128278\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/Screen-Shot-2017-01-21-at-9.06.26-PM.png\" alt=\"From a study conducted at the Harvard-Westlake school.\" width=\"511\" height=\"161\" \/><\/a> From a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25028798\">study<\/a> conducted at the Harvard-Westlake school.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nIndependent Study preps are essential to Paly students because\u00a0it is unhealthy to constantly demand so much from these already over-achieving student athletes. A student's health should be their primary concern, and they should not have to sacrifice it to play a sport and do well in school.\r\n\r\nSophomore Sydney Liu is an avid softball player. Getting sleep and rest is the main reason she wants an Independent Study prep; however, because she plays softball, she cannot get one.\r\n\r\n\"People always say that students should get a minimum of\u00a0eight hours of sleep,\" Liu said. \"It's kind of hard to do that when I\u00a0spend a total of four hours almost every day traveling and practicing for [my]\u00a0sport. Getting that extra hour and a\u00a0half to do homework during school hours would really help me prevent going to bed at 12 every night.\"\r\n\r\nConsequently, while PE is a necessary class to keep students in shape, students who already do 15 hours of a sport outside of school should not be required to partake in it and should be given the option to easily\u00a0apply for\u00a0an Independent Study prep. This prep would keep help maintain both the physical and mental health of\u00a0students. Additionally, because\u00a0all sports are physically demanding and time-consuming, there should be no restriction on which sport a student must play in order to qualify for Independent Study PE.","excerpt":"In order to qualify for Independent Study Physical Education, a student must play a sport that is not offered at Palo Alto High School. \r\n","date":"2017-01-23 17:30:39","author":"Soumya Jhaveri","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/Screen-Shot-2017-01-21-at-8.42.27-PM-11.png","categories":["Opinion","Spotlight"],"tags":["diepenbrock","duran","independent study","kat merk","opinion","paly sports","pe","prep","sports"]},{"id":128280,"title":"Slideshow: Local demonstrators make a statement on Inauguration Day","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2017\/01\/23\/slideshow-local-demonstrators-make-a-statement-on-inauguration-day\/","content":"On Friday, demonstrators lined up on a stretch of El Camino, many just a few feet away from Palo Alto High School; some protested the\u00a0inauguration of Donald Trump as the 45th President of the United States while others attended for different reasons.

Both players returned to the game in the second half.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Up next, the Vikings are set to take on Fremont High School (5-6-2, 0-4-0) at 3:30 p.m. next Tuesday in Fremont.<\/span>","excerpt":"With seconds left on the clock, Palo Alto High School girls' soccer team member senior defender Talia Malchin attempted one last desperate shot on goal off of a corner kick in an effort to break the tie with the Los Gatos Wildcats (8-3-1, 2-1-1), but the ball hit the crossbar of the goal. Despite high pressure from the Paly team's (8-0-3, 2-0-3) offense, the team was unable to capitalize on key moments in its scoreless draw, 0-0, against the Wildcats on Thursday at Paly.","date":"2017-01-19 22:13:41","author":"Emma van der Veen","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/IMG_8606.jpg","categories":["Sports"],"tags":["devlin","girls soccer","japic","kurt","los gatos","malchin","maloney","palo alto high school","palo alto high school girls soccer","Soccer","sports","tomz","vikings"]},{"id":128173,"title":"Girls&#8217; basketball to face Homestead for the first time in recent history","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2017\/01\/19\/girls-basketball-to-face-homestead-for-the-first-time-in-recent-history\/","content":"<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the first time in recent history Palo Alto High School girls' basketball (11-3, 4-0) will be taking on the Homestead High School Mustangs (8-7, 1-3) \u2014 a recently added De Anza League contender \u2014 at 6:15 p.m. tomorrow at Gunn High School.<\/span>\r\n\r\nWith an impressive De Anza league start, the Vikings are currently ranked first in leagues and are well-positioned to make it deep into the Central Coast Section Playoffs and California Interscholastic Federation state playoffs.\r\n\r\nThe Vikings have only dropped three non-league games throughout their current season, all to high-ranked schools like St. Mary\u2019s High School (11-3, 0-0) out of Stockton, California who are currently ranked fifth in the state, and 13th in the nation. Along with this loss, Paly lost nail-biting games to Pinewood High School (13-2, 2-0) and Castro Valley High School (13-3, 3-0), by two points and five points, respectively.\r\n\r\nRigorous games like these have prepared the Vikings for upcoming league matchups, according to senior forward Skylar Burris.\r\n\r\n\"Playing against teams that are as good as Saint Mary's and Pinewood forces us to recognize how hard we have to work to get to that level,\" Burris said. \"We can't drop to the level of the competition, and by playing against great teams it forces us to play great as well, setting a standard for even our least competitive game.\"\r\n\r\nHomestead is new to the De Anza League this year, as the team\u00a0moved up from the El Camino League after demolishing their competition with a 12-0 league record last season. The Mustangs replaced the Los Altos High School Eagles (6-9, 2-2), who went 2-10 in the De Anza League last year.\r\n\r\nThe Viking offense will again be led by\u00a0Burris and junior guard Carly Leong, who have made a name for themselves by consistently draining shots from beyond the arc. According to\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.maxpreps.com\/high-schools\/palo-alto-vikings-(palo-alto,ca)\/girls-basketball\/home.htm\" target=\"_blank\">maxpreps<\/a>, Paly ranks 4th in California and 28th nationally for most 3-point shots made.\r\n\r\nAccording to Leong, one of the keys to the game for Paly is controlling the tempo and staying disciplined.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe cannot play down to their level, because if we do they would have a good chance of winning,\u201d Leong said. \u201cWe just have to play our game and keep shooting and shoot transition shots even if we are up by a lot, and focus on defense.\u201d\r\n\r\nHomestead is coming off a, 58-56 league win against Gunn High School (9-8, 3-2) whom the Vikings beat with a score of 72-63 on Jan. 6.\r\n\r\nFollowing the game against the Mustangs, Paly will have seven more league games before heading into the playoffs.","excerpt":"For the first time in recent history Palo Alto High School girls' basketball (11-3, 4-0) will be taking on the Homestead High School Mustangs (8-7, 1-3) \u2014 a recently added De Anza League contender \u2014 at 6:15 p.m. tomorrow at Gunn High School.\r\n\r\n","date":"2017-01-19 22:12:48","author":"Isabella Marcus","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/DSC_00321.jpg","categories":["Sports"],"tags":["basketball","carly leong","girls basketball","homestead","paly","skylar burris","vikings"]},{"id":128122,"title":"Students and staff to face off in winter rally","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2017\/01\/19\/students-and-staff-to-face-off-in-winter-rally\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_114584\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"614\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/unnamed.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-114584 \" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/unnamed.jpg\" alt=\"unnamed\" width=\"614\" height=\"287\" \/><\/a> Participants in last year's rally line up for a photo.

Senior varsity soccer captain Derek Schoenberger hopes to be selected to coach the student soccer team. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI've always wanted to be a part of the soccer rally ever since we could no longer do the basketball rally as a result of the gym being under construction,\u201d Schoenberger said. \u201cThe rivalry between students and staff has always been exciting and I really want to have a more significant role in helping the students defeat the Paly staff.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, this year\u2019s Prom location will be revealed at the event. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to the prom location and people\u2019s reactions, because the venue is going to be sweet,\u201d Maloney said.<\/span>","excerpt":"Students will be looking for revenge in the winter rally next Thursday after losing to the teachers in last year's student vs. staff soccer game.","date":"2017-01-19 15:43:57","author":"Maya Akkaraju","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/16145278_595442037309420_241543337_o.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":["ASB","prom","Soccer","Staff","student","winter rally"]},{"id":128088,"title":"Slideshow: Girls&#8217; soccer pulls off hard-fought win","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2017\/01\/17\/slideshow-girls-soccer-pulls-off-hard-fought-win\/","content":"The Palo Alto High School girls' soccer team (8-0-1, 2-0-1) continues its undefeated streak winning 2-0 versus Homestead High School (7-3-2, 1-2) despite a weak showing.\r\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/1sZuAYQEZFVPlILDo9-11IMBSAtsTSrH6ig7pyUp-lu0\/embed?start=true&amp;loop=true&amp;delayms=3000\" width=\"700\" height=\"550\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe>","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School girls soccer team (8-0-1, 2-0-1) continues its undefeated streak winning 2-0 versus Homestead High School (7-3-2, 1-2) despite a weak showing.","date":"2017-01-17 19:44:35","author":"Ethan Kao","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/IMG_8245.jpg","categories":["Sports","Spotlight"],"tags":["girls","homestead","Soccer","undefeated","win"]}]
