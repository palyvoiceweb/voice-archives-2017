Illustration: Timothy Liu.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe 45th president of the United States had a very busy first week in which he issued several executive orders reflective of his major campaign promises. Below is a list of some of the most noteworthy actions taken\u00a0 by President Donald J. Trump during his first week in the Oval Office.\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/the-press-office\/2017\/01\/2\/executive-order-minimizing-economic-burden-patient-protection-and\">Affordable Care Act:<\/a><\/strong>\r\n\r\nThe president's first executive order was passed on the day of his inauguration, which is a relatively vague order aiming to \"minimize the economic burden\" of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\r\n\r\nIt begins with President Trump declaring that his administration will work to replace and repeal the act. The order itself is intended to reduce costs of the Affordable Care Act until this replacement occurs.\r\n\r\nWashington executives with authority under the act, such as\u00a0 have the power to \"waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision or requirement of the Act that would impose a fiscal burden on any State or a cost, fee, tax, penalty, or regulatory burden on individuals, families, healthcare providers, health insurers, patients, recipients of healthcare services, purchasers of health insurance, or makers of medical devices, products, or medications.\"\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/the-press-office\/2017\/01\/24\/executive-order-expediting-environmental-reviews-and-approvals-high\">Environmental Reviews and Infrastructure:<\/a><\/strong>\r\n\r\nTrump's next executive order was passed four days later, this time \"expediting environmental reviews and approvals for high priority infrastructure projects.\" Trump identifies the purpose of the order as an effort to increase the efficiency of decisions to promote infrastructure investment in order\u00a0to grow the American economy.\r\n\r\nThe president aims to expedite the process by implementing a 30-day period following a project's proposal, during which time the importance will be determined. If it is deemed to be highly beneficial to the \"general welfare\" of the nation, it will be labeled as a \"high priority.\"\r\n\r\nThe Chairman of the Council of Environmental Quality and the head of the relevant agency will then design \"expedited procedures and deadlines\" for the completion of environmental reviews and approvals of \"high priority\" projects.\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/the-press-office\/2017\/01\/25\/presidential-executive-order-enhancing-public-safety-interior-united\">Sanctuary Cities:<\/a><\/strong>\r\n\r\nOn Jan. 25, Trump issued another executive order that addresses sanctuary cities, which violate federal law by shielding undocumented immigrants from deportation.\r\n\r\nTrump introduces the order by stating \"The purpose of this order is to direct executive departments and agencies (agencies) to employ all lawful means to enforce the immigration laws of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nThe action will also \"ensure that jurisdictions that fail to comply with applicable Federal law do not receive Federal funds, except as mandated by law.\"\r\n\r\nTrump also emphasizes his desire for government agencies to utilize \"all available resources\" in ensuring that immigration laws and regulations are followed without exception.\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/the-press-office\/2017\/01\/25\/executive-order-border-security-and-immigration-enforcement-improvements\">Illegal Immigration\/The Wall:<\/a><\/strong>\r\n\r\nPresident Trump's next executive order, which was issued on Jan. 25, was intended to reduce the strain on both federal resources and federal organizations responsible for maintaining border security. Trump specifically names illegal immigration across the southern border as the cause of this strain. In line with one of President Trump's most notable campaign promises, this executive order begins the process of constructing a wall on America's border with Mexico.\r\n\r\nThe action's most notable component is the process to \"secure the southern border of the United States through the immediate construction of a physical wall on the southern border, monitored and supported by adequate personnel so as to prevent illegal immigration, drug and human trafficking, and acts of terrorism.\"\r\n\r\nThe order also pushes government agencies to speed up the process of determining the eligibility of a person detained on suspicion of violating US immigration policy.\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/the-press-office\/2017\/01\/27\/executive-order-protecting-nation-foreign-terrorist-entry-united-states\">Restriction on Immigration\/Travel:<\/a><\/strong>\r\n\r\nOn Jan. 27, Trump passed an executive order which implements a \"Suspension of Issuance of Visas and Other Immigration Benefits to Nationals of Countries of Particular Concern.\" These countries include Iraq, Iran, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Somalia and Libya.\r\n\r\nTrump also ordered that for a 90 day period, \"immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of aliens\" from these 7 countries will be restricted. Foreign nationals traveling on certain diplomatic visas will be exempt from this restriction.\r\n\r\nTravelers who are detained are subject to vetting and investigation. Once they have been evaluated, the travelers will be either be permitted access to the country or denied it, depending on whether or not they can be confirmed as peaceful.\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/the-press-office\/2017\/01\/28\/executive-order-ethics-commitments-executive-branch-appointees\">Ethics Pledge:<\/a><\/strong>\r\n\r\nThe president issued yet another executive order on Jan. 28, consisting of nine major ethical commitments which the members of his executive branch must uphold. These commitments range from preventing members of his cabinet from participating in certain lobbying activities, to keeping members of his cabinet from being influenced by lobbyists during their service.\r\n\r\nThe order also mandates that the members of his cabinet carefully read and then sign the document.\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/the-press-office\/2017\/01\/27\/executive-order-protecting-nation-foreign-terrorist-entry-united-states\">Government Regulation of Business:<\/a><\/strong>\r\n\r\nOn Jan. 28, the president passed an executive order impacting federal regulation of business. This executive order requires a minimum of two previously existing governmental regulations of business to be proposed for elimination whenever a new policy is implemented. It is in line with his \"one in two out\" campaign promise.\r\n\r\nTrump declared that that it \"is important that for every one new regulation issued, at least two prior regulations be identified for elimination, and that the cost of planned regulations be prudently managed and controlled through a budgeting process.\"\r\n\r\nThis executive order specifically affects the \"fiscal year 2017, which is in progress\". This statement restricts the longevity of the order to the end of this fiscal year.\r\n\r\nThe order also mandates that \"the total incremental cost\" of\u00a0 all new regulations, including repealed regulations, finalized in 2017 cannot exceed zero, unless otherwise required by law or if advised by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (Director).\r\n\r\nTrump has had a very busy first week, and this will not be the end of his actions as president. Check back with The Paly Voice for future breakdowns of the Trump administration's actions.","excerpt":"The 45th president of the United States had a very busy first week in which he issued several executive orders reflective of his major campaign promises.

The Vikings would go on to shut out the Spartans, ending Mountain View's winning streak and prolonging their own. Photo: Jackson Doerr[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThough it is a common conception that Palo Alto High School's primary athletic rival is either Gunn or Los Gatos, if you ask a member of the girls' soccer team, the response will overwhelmingly be \u201cMountain View.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was the Spartans who stopped the Vikings from winning the Central Coast Section final in 2015. It was Mountain View that ended the Vikings' chance at a perfect season in 2016. Other teams may see Mountain View as a tough opponent, but nothing more than that: they have no vendetta with the Spartans the way the girls\u2019 soccer team does.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s fitting, then, that Paly would face off against Mountain View in almost the exact same position that they were in a year ago, with the Vikes\u2019 undefeated record on the line. But this time, instead of faltering for the third time, the Vikings prevailed, emerging with a 2-0 victory, propelling them into first place in the De Anza League, with an almost spotless record of 5-0-3, edging out Mountain View\u2019s record of 5-1-1.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The highlight of the game occurred late in the first half, with the ball being fiercely contested by both teams, neither side maintaining possession for longer than a minute. Senior defender Lauola Amanoni spotted an opening, sprinting up from the back line, she received a pass from freshman midfielder Chloe Japic. Dribbling the ball up the middle, Amanoni beat out two consecutive Spartan defenders and fired a shot from way beyond the 18-yard line into the goal. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amanoni\u2019s goal woke the Vikings up; their play became more precise, and not five minutes later they had scored again, this time a goal by Japic.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the Vikes may have shut the Spartans out, play was not perfect on the defensive side. Communication errors plagued Paly early in the game, leading to some goal opportunities for Mountain View.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senior midfielder Tess Preising attributes the on-field confusion to a new formation the Vikings were trying out.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWhat we didn\u2019t do too well was defending and marking because we played with a new formation,\u201d Preising said. \u201cWe were doing a 5-4-1 so some of us were confused in the midfield.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The new formation certainly caused some disarray on the field, but as the game progressed, errors appeared less and less. Chatter on the field increased, players letting each other know if they had time, or if they had to get rid of the ball immediately. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mountain View\u2019s errors came from their inability to capitalize on mistakes that Paly made. Too often the Vikes would fail to get the ball out of their back line, or if they did, it would immediately return to a Spartan player. Amanoni recognizes the team's difficulties with clearing the ball as a problem to work on. \u201cWe kept clearing it [the ball], where they were able to advance off of it.\u201d\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to head coach Kurt Devlin, Paly faced off against Mountain View down several players.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe need to work on getting healthy,\" Devlin said. \"We have a bunch of girls that are nicked up or sick, so we need to rest and get healthy for the rest of the way out.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team\u2019s next match will be against the Homestead High School Mustangs, who currently sit in the middle of the De Anza league standings with a record of 4-4-0. The game at Homestead on Thursday will give the Vikings the chance to try out their new formation again before facing third place Santa Clara High School (3-0-3) in a week.<\/span>","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School girls' soccer team emerged victorious over Mountain View with a final score of 2-0.

The march sought predominantly to advocate for women's rights, but also to stand in solidarity with the diverse communities in our country, and for the freedom of expression and choice of individuals of all races, religions, ethnicities and sexual orientations, according to the Women's\u00a0March on Washington <a href=\"https:\/\/www.womensmarch.com\/mission\/\">website<\/a>.\r\n\r\nThe crowd of 2.5 million people across the world sent a strong signal, organizers said, to the world and our government that the coming years will be unfamiliar territory, the future a time of action and bold change.\r\n\r\nThe Paly Voice marched alongside the powerful crowd and gathered personal stories of those who felt it necessary to speak up that day.\r\n\r\n<strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; color: #ff99cc;\">Scenes from the San Fransisco Women's March<\/span><\/strong>\r\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/tpFMypWPvZA\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; color: #ff99cc;\"><strong>Locations of sister marches throughout California<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\r\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/d\/embed?mid=16Ryr-xl3ghrwTItdGlV_megnmqA\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\"><\/iframe>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-size: 18pt; color: #ff99cc;\"><strong>The Train\u00a0<\/strong><\/span>\r\n\r\nAt the Caltrain station on the way to the protest, Palo Altans formed a crowd sporting pink \"pussy hats,\" a reference to a leaked video of\u00a0President Trump remark's towards women\u00a0and holding bright colored signs. The line for the ticket booth, including this group of reporters for The Paly Voice, stretched to the other side of the station and the ticket dispensers ran out of exact change for the demonstrators. An excited energy of anticipation prickled the air as people stood waiting for the 2:30 p.m. train.\r\n\r\nStanford student Yaelle Viner was one demonstrator wearing a pink hat. She smiled through the cold air as she explained why she found it necessary to partake in the march.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have a 6-year-old sister, and granted she is a little young to understand socio-political issues, but I am marching so [that] she is able to see a world as progressive as I have seen in my lifetime,\u201d Viner said.\r\n\r\nHer friend, Grace Wallace, stressed the importance of advocating for intersectional feminism, emphasizing that we must remember how limited an individualist viewpoint can be.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_128533\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"370\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/trainstation.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-128533\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/trainstation.jpg\" alt=\"trainstation\" width=\"370\" height=\"247\" \/><\/a> Palo Alto student protesters Grace Wallace, Emma Rothenburg, Yaelle Viner and Sarah Vernalis hold a poster reading, \"I march for intersectional feminism.\" Photo: Rachel Code.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n\u201cI am marching to show that feminist causes are intersectional and apply to many different people,\" Wallace said. \u00a0\"All of them are equally valid and need to be heard. My sign reads, \u2018I march for intersectional feminism\u2019 and then on the back, \u2018not open-minded fascism.' Intersectionality is basically the theory that identities coalesce to form different experiences\u00a0so that the experience of a white-identifying woman and a black-identifying woman will not be the same and it is important to acknowledge those differences.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs the train arrived, the demonstrators filled the train-cars past their limit, no seat remained empty, no isle devoid of pink. People clung to the windows and each other, cramped on stairs and in walkways as they made their way into the city.\r\n\r\nBella Gaberal, a Gunn High School senior riding the Caltrain, reflected on the excitement of taking part in a global movement.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt\u2019s [The protest is] happening worldwide and in many countries,\u201d Gaberal\u00a0said. \u201cTo me it\u2019s just a promise to keep fighting.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\nAs the journey continued and the train reached the San Francisco station, the lines, between young and old, between the Palo-Altan and the San Francisco natives, between race, gender, ethnicity mingled into a\u00a0single entity as the crowd bonded in a common purpose.\r\n\r\nEmma Rothenburg, protester and college\u00a0student, grew up surrounded by\u00a0a powerful female environment. For her, it was important that her mom, her sister and all women and men alike were marching, although separated by miles, together.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am marching with my mother and sister \u2014 my mother is down in southern California and my sister will be in S.F. so I am joining them,\u201d Rothenburg said. \u201cI was raised by a strong female, who was also raised by another strong female and so on.\u00a0I know there is nothing a woman can't do and I want everyone to know that.\u201d\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_128548\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/littleboy1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-128548\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/littleboy1.jpg\" alt=\"littleboy\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" \/><\/a> A small boy sits on the shoulders of his father amidst the wild crowds of the San Francisco Women's March at the Civic Center Plaza on Jan. 21.

Instead, they embraced the cold dreary weather in a sort of protest, taking out pink rain jackets and vibrant umbrella\u2019s and craning their necks to listen to Supervisor Jane Kim as she passionately spoke into the microphone insisting that San Francisco has an important role in gender equality and women\u2019s rights. This was followed by speakers making statements about the election and \"moving forward.\"\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the night moved on, folk singer Joan Baez and queer hip hop artist <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MicahTron<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">performed, energizing the crowd and moving most to their feet regardless of age.

Thousands of people poured into dark San Francisco streets lit up by red lanterns, the light reflecting off puddles and raindrops still clinging to umbrellas and jackets, that in turn illuminated the streets with a warm flickering glow.

Led by Burris and a strong defensive performance in the second and third quarter, the Vikings were able to steamroll the Titans, 61-45.\r\n\r\nBurris led the Vikings to a dominant victory, leading the team in scoring, whilst grabbing six rebounds, two assists and a steal.\r\n<div class=\"_1t_p clearfix\">\r\n<div class=\"_41ud\">\r\n<div class=\"clearfix _o46 _3erg _29_7 direction_ltr text_align_ltr\">\r\n<div id=\"js_41\" class=\"_3058 _ui9 _hh7 _s1- _52mr _3oh-\" data-tooltip-content=\"1:18pm\" data-hover=\"tooltip\" data-tooltip-position=\"right\">\r\n\r\n<span class=\"_3oh- _58nk\">\"My team needed me to score this game, so I knew I had to step up to do so,\" Burris said. \"I was sent to the free throw line a lot last night, so a lot of my baskets were easy points.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\nJunior Carly Leong filled up the stat-sheet, scoring 10 points, collecting five rebounds and dishing five assists.

Rojahn's job? Shoot three-pointers\u2014 lots of them. Playing in his second consecutive season on the Palo Alto High School boys' basketball team (16-2, 7-0), Rojahn and\u00a0fellow three-point juggernaut junior guard\u00a0Jared Wulbrun, have become the \"splash brothers\" of the Paly team. Rojahn provided the spark to the Vikings' domination of the Gunn High School Titans' basketball team (11-7, 2-5) on Friday, 79-36, hitting a couple three-pointers in the opening minutes, electrifying the crowd and setting the tone for the rest of the night.\u00a0With half of the regular season in the books, the Vikings remain the top dogs in the De Anza League.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_128729\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"475\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/spencer-celebrating.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-128729\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/spencer-celebrating.jpg\" alt=\"Junior guard Spencer Rojahn gets pumped up by fellow junior guard Brey Johnson pregame.

Rojahn hit two early three-pointers on Friday against Gunn High School. Photo: Rachel Code[\/caption]\r\n\r\nOver the course of play, Paly's swarming defense proved to be too much to handle for the Titans. Midway through the second quarter, Paly scored on three consecutive stolen passes and did not\u00a0allow the Gunn offense to pass the half-court line during those three possessions. A combination of the\u00a0Viking starting lineups' average height of just under six foot three inches and\u00a0a strong press defense enabled Paly to play at its desired game tempo and forced countless Titan turnovers.\r\n\r\nTo accompany the exceptional play of the starting lineup, \u00a0junior point guard Will Schmutz subbed in for senior starting point guard and team captain Miles Tention in the second half and excited the crowd with 11 points of his own. \"MVP\" chants erupted from the Paly sections following each of Schmutz's baskets. Also off the bench, junior guard Brey Johnson, junior center Bryant Jefferson, senior point guard Ethan Stern and senior guard Jack Simison added to the insurmountable Viking lead with a combined 25 points off the bench. Johnson added the exclamation point on the blowout win with a huge block on a Gunn guard during the closing minutes of the game.\r\n\r\nThe Titans struggled to find their groove on offense, ending the game without a double-digit scorer. Gunn senior forward Jeffery Lee-Heidenreich led the Titans with nine points, and senior guard Josh Radin poured in six of his own.\r\n\r\nPaly head coach Peter Diepenbrock said the Vikings' continued dominance has played a large factor in the team's mindset moving forward.\r\n\r\n\"We've won eight games\u00a0in a row and we keep improving so it's huge,\" Diepenbrock said. \"This win reconfirms what we're trying to do and it shows that we're going in the right direction.\"\r\n\r\nDespite the lengthy winning streak, Diepenbrock has seen this story before and said the team needs to remain grounded after its successes. Last season, the Vikings headed into the Central Coast Section playoffs having won the majority of the match-ups leading up the first round of CCS\u00a0but\u00a0were defeated in the first round.\r\n\r\n\"That's the challenge,\" Diepenbrock said. \"We have to be a much more mature team. Last year we couldn't handle this so hopefully we will keep practicing hard and keep our focus because we have bigger goals than just to win the league.\"\r\n\r\nJunior forward William Schlemmer said the team needs to remain grounded despite the big win\u00a0and understand that the Vikings will need to continue to improve in order to compete with some of their tougher opponents.\r\n\r\n\"We need to tower on half-court offense because the games we have difficulty in are those where the pace is slower and we can't get buckets in transition,\" Schlemmer said. \"This game shows that we need to be able to play with the intensity of [the Gunn game] every game even though we might not be as excited\u00a0because if we play as intensely as we do against Gunn,\u00a0we are hard to stop.\"\r\n\r\nThe Vikings outscored the Titans 21-2 in just under six minutes of play\u00a0and continued to add to their lead, heading into\u00a0the half with a sizable 38-18 advantage. Paly would go on to obliterate Gunn for the second and final time this year by a score of 79-36, beating the Titans\u00a0by 14 more points that the matchup earlier this season. Diepenbrock encourages the Paly community to bring the same roaring energy to the Vikings'\u00a0next big match-up on Saturday at Menlo-Atherton High School.\r\n\r\n\"Get it done. How much fun could that be?\" Depenbrock said. \"Going into an opposing gym and having the [expletive] place covered. Go to [Menlo-Atherton].\"\r\n\r\nUp next for the Vikings are league rematches against teams the boys already defeated handily. On Tuesday, the Vikings face the Los Altos High School Eagles (10-9, 2-5) at Los Altos and on Friday, Paly faces off against the Wilcox High School Chargers (9-9, 4-3).\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"The Vikings' dominated the Gunn High School Titans' basketball team (11-7, 2-5) on Friday, 79-36.
