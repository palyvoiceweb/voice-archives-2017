Photo: Manchester by the sea website[\/caption]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"Manchester by the Sea\" is a heartbreaking tale of loss, love and mistakes that leave wounds ingrained so deep that try as we might, they will never truly heal. This film is not Hollywood, or heartwarming, or sunny skies and perfect endings. Instead, it is meant to be ingested slowly, as it pulls you in gently like a gasp of cold winter air, until it leaves you breathless.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The film follows Lee (Casey Affleck), a janitor from Boston whose apathy is a mask for the inextinguishable rage he feels towards the world and himself. After the death of his brother Joe (Kyle Chandler), Lee returns to his hometown astonished to find that he is now the legal guardian of his brother's teenage son (Lucas Hedges).\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Manchester by the Sea has managed to pull back the curtain. It tells the story of life lived in the real world, full of loose ends, unlearned lessons and pains that will never leave you. To watch it is like witnessing a conversation through a window, or maybe the lack of conversation \u2014 mundane interchanges saturated in all things left unsaid, that will never be said.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The movie is masterfully set in Manchester-by-the-sea, Massachusetts. Jazz interludes play throughout scenes of water rippling docked boats and snow gently layering on rooftops, serving to orchestrate a beautiful portrait of this port town during the passing of seasons. However, as the movie progresses we begin to feel the stagnation, the feeling of time being stopped, paralleling perfectly with Lee\u2019s emotions. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Massachusetts hometown of the title looms oppressively over Lee, and it is slowly drowning him. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lee, we begin to understand, bears the burden of a terrible tragedy, which caused his exile not only from his hometown but from life. To return to Manchester is to reopen a wound that Lee never healed, because he couldn't. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The music in the film is calm and playful, seeming to reflect the town's peaceful exterior but in stark contrast to the raging emotions that Lee hides behind closed expressions. The climax of the movie is paralleled with a stunning crescendo of strings and woodwinds that play deafeningly throughout an entire scene without dialogue, revealing the unbearable truth in Lee\u2019s past. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Affleck's expressions are pulsing with compressed rage, emotions so tightly wound that throughout the first half of the movie you want to scream at him. His performance is raw and harrowing, and through a series of flashbacks that jab at Lee\u2019s mind we finally understand that underneath his rage there is a deep and consuming sadness. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hedges as Patrick, Lee\u2019s teenage nephew, is perfectly vulnerable, angry and compassionate. The bond that forms between the two main characters through humorous and tentative exchanges is beautiful, heartbreaking and frustrating as it layered in things that can never be really dealt with or spoken out loud. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Manchester by the Sea is heartbreaking and sorrowful. It paints a portrait of life as it really is, where things are often left broken. It is masterfully subtle and delicate, yet at the same time harrowingly deafening.<\/span>\r\n\r\nManchester by the sea is nominated for 6 Oscars including Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role, Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role, Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role, Best Achievement in Directing, and Best Writing Original Screenplay. \u00a0The film previously won a Golden Globes for\u00a0Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture as well as several other awards\r\n\r\n<strong>\u201cManchester by the Sea\u201d<\/strong>\r\n\r\n2 hours, 17 minutes\r\n\r\nRated R for some language\r\n\r\nDirected by Kenneth Lonergan\r\n\r\nStarring Casey Affleck, Michelle Williams, Lucas Hedges\r\n\r\nOscar Nominations: Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role (Casey Affleck), Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role (Michelle Williams), Best Achievement in Directing, and Best Writing Original Screenplay.","excerpt":"&nbsp; &#8220;Manchester by the Sea&#8221; is a heartbreaking tale of loss, love and mistakes that leave wounds ingrained so deep that try as we might, <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2017\/02\/16\/moving-manchester-by-the-sea\/#more-'\" class=\"more-link\">more &raquo;<\/a>","date":"2017-02-16 23:30:37","author":"Emilia Diaz-Magaloni","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/manchester-lead.jpg","categories":["Entertainment","Oscars 2017","Uncategorized"],"tags":[]},{"id":129706,"title":"Undefeated girls&#8217; soccer heads into CCS after shutout win against Fremont","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2017\/02\/16\/undefeated-girls-soccer-heads-into-ccs-after-shutout-win-against-fremont\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_129710\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"499\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/IMG_0933.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-129710 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/IMG_0933.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_0933\" width=\"499\" height=\"432\" \/><\/a> Junior midfielder Darrow Hornik takes a shot at the Fremont goalkeeper in Palo Alto High School's 5-0 victory on Tuesday.

Some teams are unable to\u00a0boast about having a winning record. The Paly girls\u2019 soccer team can proudly boast both of those things as they shut out Fremont High School (0-11-0) 5-0, in the last game of the regular season on Tuesday.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\nThis is the fifth year in a row that the girls\u2019 soccer team has ended its regular season with a winning record. In those five years, the most games the team has lost in a season was two. With the regular season coming to a close, the focus is turning towards the postseason and the Central Coast Section playoffs. This will be the team's fourth season in a row to return to CCS and for the team\u2019s seniors, it is their last chance at winning a championship. The Vikes came close in 2015, but were defeated in the championship game by Mountain View High School.\r\n\r\nWith the regular season now over, senior captain and midfielder Natalie Maloney reflects back on her time with the team. \u201cJust thinking about it all makes me realize how much fun I\u2019ve had and how much I love the girls,\u201d Maloney said. \u201cIt seems like I was a freshman just last week. \u00a0It\u2019s kinda surreal that time has gone by so fast.\u201d\r\n\r\nMaloney played a key role in the game on Tuesday, scoring two out of the five goals and frequently setting up her fellow teammates. The Viking's victory was not perfect, despite keeping possesion of the ball for almost the entire game, Paly was unable to follow up on several goal opportunities. Moving forward into CCS this is something the team needs to work on.\u00a0These issues were something senior defender Lauola Amanoni noticed.\r\n\r\n\"[It was] definitely not our best [game], but a good one to remember,\" Amanoni said. \"[It] wasn't the most difficult, but wasn't an easy win.\"\r\n\r\nPaly is currently first in the De Anza league with a record of (8-0-4) but that could change as several teams still have not played their final games, including Mountain View High School, currently in second place with a record of (8-1-2). Mountain View's game against Los Gatos High School could bump Paly from their first place position.\r\n\r\nThe Vikings' next game has yet to be decided, official CCS match ups will be announced in a week.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"Not many teams at Palo Alto High School can boast an undefeated record.

(Flex, in this case, is not the same as the Flex period listed on Paly's Tuesday afternoon schedule, which was formerly referred to as Tutorial.)\r\n\r\nFormer Palo Alto High School Teacher on Special Assignment and the current Coordinator for Educational Technology and Libraries at the district level, Emily Garrison, explains that blended learning is a push for moving education into the 21st century.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe now know that in the 21st century, living in the information age, learning doesn\u2019t happen like it used to in the past. You have a phone in your pocket that has access to the entirety of humanity\u2019s knowledge,\" Garrison said. \"That 19th century model of the teacher being the center of knowledge just doesn\u2019t make sense anymore. Does learning have to be confined to third period? No, absolutely not. You all can go do your school work in many places and at a time that works best for you. Or, you can stay on campus and work more closely with your teacher in a small group.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Garrison, the concept of blended learning is approximately a decade old, but only reached Palo Alto Unified School District in 2009, when Gunn High school history teacher Brian Tuomy decided to experiment with a new type of class. This first class, now referred to as a \u201cTwilight blended class,\u201d met every Wednesday evenings for two and a half to three hours, giving the participating students a prep period during the school day. Garrison explains that when the students were not in class, \u201cthey used Schoology to do work at their own path, place and location, for however long it took them to complete the work.\u201d\r\n\r\nGarrison explains that Tuomy then became the first blended learning TOSA, and decided to start a training program.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn 2011, he got together the first cohort of Gunn and Paly teachers, all of whom volunteered to be a part of an intense 60-hour certification program,\u201d Garrison said. \u201cThey completed something called \u2018The Leading Edge Certification Program,' which is basically a training program for teachers that want to start teaching in more of an online modality.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe second cohort, which ran in fall 2013, switched training programs in order to get a better understanding of how to use Schoology for the purpose of blended learning.\r\n\r\n\u201cUnlike the first cohort that was composed of mostly Gunn teachers, this second cohort was pretty evenly mixed,\u201d Garrison said. \u201cThis time we decided to complete another training program with an outside instructor, but we did everything through Schoology. This was so powerful because teachers were essentially students on Schoology, so we could experience what it would be like for our students.\u201d\r\n\r\nRight after Garrison became the blended learning TOSA, she decided with Tuomy that they would be creating their own certification program.\r\n\r\n\u201cBrian Tuomy and I used our experience in blended learning in Palo Alto and we created our own Schoology training course,\u201d Garrison said. \u201cIt still exists today, and it keeps getting better every year.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Garrison, Tuomy stepped down as the Gunn TOSA before the fifth cohort and was replaced with Gunn's Chris Bell, a math and computer science teacher.\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Bell and I have now worked with approximately 65 teachers that are trained in blended learning in the district,\u201d Garrison said. \u201cIn the spring we have a \u2018Blended Learning Symposium,\u2019 where all the teachers come together and learn from one another\u2019s experiences.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Garrison, not all teachers who complete the training program end up running blended classes.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have found that it works really well if we run this training program in the spring, and then over the course of the entire following year, the teachers that participated can experiment with different levels of blended learning in their classroom,\u201d Garrison said. \u201cWhen that year is over, teachers can decide if they want to informally continue to use blended learning concepts, or if they want their following year\u2019s class to be a formal blended course, otherwise known as a \u2018full-release\u2019 course. To be listed as a full-release course, the only requirement is that online coursework does not to exceed 49 percent of the course time.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, whether or not a blended learning class runs is completely up to the students.\r\n\r\n\"There have been teachers that have wanted to teach blended classes, who have prepared for them, and then it just doesn't work out,\" Garrison said. \"For a blended course to run, it has to be published in the course catalog, and just like any other class, it has to have enough students register.\"","excerpt":"Just like chefs, teachers of blended learning classes are handed a basic recipe for success, and then given the opportunity to add their own unique twist to the process.","date":"2017-02-15 22:50:29","author":"Daniella Maydan","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/Blended-learning.jpg","categories":["Features","Spotlight"],"tags":["21st century learning","blended learning","brian tui","chris bell","cohort","emily garrison","PAUSD","twilight classes"]},{"id":129565,"title":"Fifteen blended courses to be offered next year","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2017\/02\/15\/fifteen-blended-courses-to-be-offered-next-year\/","content":"<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Assistant Principal Victoria Kim, Paly will be offering 15 <a href=\"http:\/\/paly.io\/v\/125499\">blended classes<\/a> next year.

You may have seen me around campus with a San Jose Sharks beanie or jersey on because that's what most of my apparel consists of. Hockey is interesting to me because of the history and tradition that is connected with it. Last month I had the wonderful opportunity to attend a centennial celebration of the National Hockey League at the SAP Center, home of the Sharks.<\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The year 2017 marks the NHL\u2019s 100th year of existence. To celebrate this event, the NHL organized Centennial Fan Arenas in NHL cities in both the United States and Canada. The tour lasts from January through December.<\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The San Jose Sharks are the first NHL team to participate in this touring tribute. Our local celebration was a favorite for hockey fans and also a great way to introduce hockey to those who don\u2019t know much about the game and its history. The celebration included responsive games and multiple free giveaways with appearances from Sharkie, the Sharks mascot, and the team's cheerleaders.<\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The main attraction was a 53-foot museum truck with an innovative interior featuring more than 1,000 square feet of interactive digital displays, videos, historical memorabilia and unique photo opportunities. A high-tech feature of the tour was the Clear The Ice Zamboni VR Experience. This never-before-seen VR experience allowed\u00a0fans to compete against each other in a race to resurface the ice. Fans could also take a seat in a mini-Zamboni ice resurfacer, feel cool air on their skin and rumble in their seats as they attempted to make a\u00a0perfect sheet of ice \u2014 in virtual reality. All fans were allowed to race, were timed and shared on a leaderboard for everyone to see.<\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The most memorable feature of the event was the appearance of the Stanley Cup: one of the oldest and most revered trophies in professionals sports. The trophy was displayed at the Centennial Fan Arena where visitors took photos with it. Standing next to the cup, seeing the names of all the players and teams who won it, had a profound effect on me. The greatest players ever to play the game had raised this same trophy.<\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">According to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.quanthockey.com\/nhl\/us-state\/active-nhl-players-born-in-california-career-stats.html\">Quanth Hockey website<\/a>, which provides hockey statistics on NHL records and locations of every player's birth cities and states. It shows that relative to other sports in the area, hockey is not as popular a sport in California, based on the number of players drafted into the NHL from the state. Hockey fans are primarily located on the East Coast and throughout Canada because of their snowy winters.<\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On the other hand, because of the success of the Sharks, Anaheim Ducks and Los Angeles Kings, fans around the world are starting to recognize the hockey fandom in California and the passion that many Californians feel about the game and their teams. Because of these teams, younger hockey players from California will have certain players they look up to and\u00a0could eventually make it to NHL themselves.<\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Last year, the Sharks went on their best run in franchise history, with their fans behind them the whole way, and after making it to the NHL Stanley Cup Finals, were within reach of the cup. The Sharks were ultimately stopped short of their dream by the Pittsburgh Penguins, who defeated them in six games in the best-of-seven series. Winning the trophy continues to be on the Sharks' mind and winning it in the 100th anniversary of the NHL would be a very memorable one.<\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The SAP event\u00a0was an example of the potential of hockey in California. Ambassadors of the sport are reaching out to Californians by teaching them about the tradition and history of the game. This interest will not change overnight, and tomorrow most Californians won't be worried about the next hockey game they will attend; however, this historic event is a sign that hockey in California is trending upward.<\/p>","excerpt":"The year 2017 marks the NHL\u2019s 100th year of existence.

Photo by: David Hickey[\/caption]\r\n\r\nDuring the 2016 off-season, the Paly boys' basketball team (19-3, 10-0) acquired five-foot-10-inch junior shooting guard Jared Wulbrun, who had just moved from Birmingham, Alabama.\u00a0Wulbrun scored 24 points in his first regular season game as a Viking, hitting six of seven three-point shots and six of seven shots from the free-throw line. Wulbrun's sharpshooting along with his court vision and high basketball IQ, will be essential as the Vikings finish out league play this week.\r\n\r\nThe\u00a0Wulbrun\u00a0family\u00a0ventured to the west coast because Jared's father, Jeff Wulbrun, accepted a job offer at Stanford University as the head assistant coach for the men's basketball team.\r\n\r\nBasketball has been a passion for Jared Wulbrun for as long as he can remember. Moving to Palo Alto, he had mixed emotions about having to assimilate to his current team.\r\n\r\n\"My first impressions were varied coming from a team that won a state title last year. I wasn't sure what the season would be like, honestly,\" Wulbrun said. \"It's always a hard thing to come into a new school, a new team, and expect everything to go smoothly. I was playing for a starting job which means you're going against others on the team for one or two spots, which can cause problems. For the most part there were no issues or hard feelings between any of us, which did nothing but help the team chemistry grow.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the preseason, Wulbrun first played with the team in an out-of-state tournament and quickly realized the strength that the team possesses.\r\n\r\n\"I soon figured out that we had something special with our group,\" Wulbrun said. \"I came [to Palo Alto]\u00a0this summer and was able to play with the team in their summer tournaments and in our second tournament in Reno, Nevada. I saw what we had the potential to accomplish this year.\"\r\n\r\nWulbrun credits senior captain and point-guard Miles Tention for making his transition smoother than he expected.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_129555\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"394\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/jared-3.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-129555\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/jared-3.jpg\" alt=\"Wulbrun launches a three-point shot against Oak Grove High School.

Photo by: David Hickey[\/caption]\r\n\r\n\"I always give credit to Miles [Tention]\u00a0for how he immediately looked for me in games and treated me like we had played together for years, even though it had only been a few weeks,\" Wulbrun said. \"That made me feel comfortable right away, making the transition easy.\"\r\n\r\nWulbrun made an immediate impact on the team, aiding the Vikings' championship in their first regular season tournament in Burlingame, which he believes set the mindset for the rest of the season.\r\n\r\n\"After [the Burlingame tournament], we all got the feeling like we could do some big things this year and so far we have, going 20-3,\" Wulbrun said. \"Everything gelled perfectly and we were playing at a very high level. My thought was that 'We\u00a0could only go up from here.'\"\r\n\r\nAccording to junior forward William Schlemmer, Wulbrun has had an impact on the team as a knock-down three-point shooter as well as a great friend.\r\n\r\n\"He's pretty much become family since I met him because he moved here over the summer and got a chance to get familiar with everyone else on the team and he's a great person to have around on and off the court,\" junior forward Will Schlemmer said. \"He's a good shooter and hustler so he's willing to do the little things to get the job done.\"\r\n\r\nHaving clinched the top seed in the De Anza League, the team looks to continue their dominance against its toughest and most anticipated league opponent of the season, the Los Gatos High School Wildcats (16-6, 6-4), who currently sit in second place in the league, at 7 p.m. on Tuesday at Gunn High School. The two teams met earlier in the season, with the Vikings dismissing their arch-rivals in an intense, 66-57, victory.\r\n\r\nDuring the his first taste of the Paly-Los Gatos feud, Wulbrun poured in 17-points, 12 of which came from beyond the arch. According to Wulbrun, he felt the intensity of the matchup and is keen to bring the heat on Tuesday.\r\n\r\n\"I've heard that at Paly, most people aren't very fond of [Los] Gatos,\" Wulbrun said. \"The first game showed that. We\u00a0need to come out on Tuesday with the same mindset that we did at their place a few weeks ago. It's also senior night, and I know we all want to send our four seniors out the right way:\u00a0at home with a huge [win] over a rival.\"\r\n\r\nTuesday's game is Paly's annual basketball \"Senior night,\" where seniors<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Tention, Jack Simison, Ethan Stern and Eelis Copeland will be honored.<\/span>\r\n\r\nFor Paly, the key to stopping the strong Los Gatos\u00a0squad is limiting the play of Wildcat six-foot-six-inch junior forward Dylan Belquist.\u00a0Belquist was named to the De Anza League first team last year as a sophomore and dunked over six-foot-five-inch tall Schlemmer for two of his 20 points the last time the two teams met.\r\n\r\n\"We\u00a0just need to play our game and make sure to not give them second chances on the offensive glass,\" Schlemmer said. \"As for Dylan we just want to play as a team and have someone besides him beat us. These next two [league] games are extremely important. One of our goals this year is to go undefeated in league and we are close to achieving that goal.\"","excerpt":"A good amount of the students attending Palo Alto High School have lived in or around the city of Palo Alto for most of, if not all, their lives.
