The Vikings aim to further their hot streak when they face the Santa Clara High School Bruins (5-1-2, 2-0) at 6 p.m. tonight at the Bruins\u2019 homefield. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Bruins are one of the more skilled teams the Vikings play during the regular season, according to senior defender Lauola Amanoni. To secure a win in the upcoming game, the Vikings have prepared during practice by working on their weaknesses: defense and ball movement.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cSanta Clara is a pretty good team so this game will surely be a competitive one especially since it's a Santa Clara home game,\u201d Amanoni said. \u201cSince we struggled last game with a couple of defensive style plays, we worked on that. We were able to practice yesterday to fix passes and find more productive ways to get the ball forward.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After a hard fought loss versus Homestead High School last Thursday, senior forward Tess Preising stresses the importance of practicing the little things.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe need to make the simple plays,\u201d Preising said. \u201cLast game [versus Homestead] we were sloppy with our possessions and were constantly dribbling into trouble. If we make the simple passes and plays, we would be in a better position to score.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\nThe Vikings are also conscious\u00a0of their undefeated streak, and hope to extend the clean record, according to Preising.\r\n\r\n\"I am looking forward to keeping our undefeated streak and obviously scoring a lot of goals this game, but scoring them creatively,\" Preising said. \"Maybe by implementing the plays we've been working on in practice or getting some off a good counter attack.\"\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amanoni expressed a mild concern for the game against Santa Clara regarding its under groomed soccer field.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cSanta Clara has poor playing field conditions that over the years made it difficult to get good results,\u201d\u00a0Amanoni said. \u201cPlaying every team, we notice that we can never look at a game as an easy win; it ends up making us always play our worst. However, Santa Clara will for sure be a good match.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\nPreising revealed\u00a0a similar view on preparing for the game.\r\n\r\n\"I think this game will be neither easy nor hard, since we've done well against Santa Clara before but I don't think we should have any expectations of what the game could be like,\" Preising said. \"It's a new year and they (Bruins) have new players, we have new players, so it really all comes down to whether we will show a good performance on the field or not today.\"","excerpt":"Aside from one tie, the Palo Alto girls\u2019 soccer team (8-0-1, 2-0-1) is on a blazing path of victories this season.

During a school board meeting on Tuesday, the board approved a <a href=\"https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/0B_Ha6_cxoBV_NThkemhiV19WR0k\/view\">resolution<\/a>\u00a0that affirms\u00a0PAUSD's support of immigrant students and families, and states PAUSD should be a sanctuary for students.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new resolution is in line with the ideas of a bill by California Democratic Sen. Kevin de Le\u00f3n. According to Patrick McGreevy of the Los Angeles Times, the<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.latimes.com\/politics\/essential\/la-pol-ca-essential-politics-updates-senate-leader-proposes-safe-zones-at-1481144070-htmlstory.html\">new bill by de Le\u00f3n<\/a>\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">will outline the implementation of \"safe zones\" for immigrants in locations like public schools, medical facilities and places of worship, which will prohibit immigration enforcement on such locations.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\nUnder this proposed bill, immigrant students would be offered a sort of political protection, according to McGreevy. For de Le\u00f3n, this is a result of concerns raised following statements made about mass-deportation during the 2016 election cycle.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cTo the millions of undocumented residents pursuing and contributing to the California dream, the state of California will be your wall of justice should the incoming administration adopt an inhumane and over-reaching mass-deportation policy,\u201d de Le\u00f3n said in\u00a0reference to the <a href=\"http:\/\/leginfo.legislature.ca.gov\/faces\/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB54\">California Values Act<\/a>.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PAUSD\u2019s own resolution outlines the board\u2019s policy on providing high-quality public education to both children of legal citizens and to those of undocumented residents. It was developed and revised by the board members themselves.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This document ensures the safety of all students in PAUSD, according to Supt. Max McGee, who says he \u201cis proud of the education PAUSD serves to every student.\u201d In a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.pausd.org\/explore-pausd\/news\/superintendents-message-boe-resolution-support-immigrant-students\">statement<\/a>\u00a0released on Thursday, McGee emphasized that PAUSD does not tolerate discrimination based on race, gender, sexual orientation, religion or national origin.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cA<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s educators, we know that students cannot learn when they do not feel welcomed and safe at school,\u201d McGee said in the statement. \u201cFor that reason, we work very hard to create and maintain safe learning environments where teachers, students and other staff members can safely learn and work together.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\nSchools are among a relatively short list of locations deemed as\u00a0\u201csensitive areas\u201d by the United States Department of Immigration and Custom Enforcement. Sensitive areas are locations in which government enforcement action is taken with an air of caution in order to maintain an environment of safety and tranquility, particularly in places of worship, education, ceremonial practices and medical facilities. The Immigration and Custom Enforcement policy also discourages enforcement actions at schools, except in cases of imminent danger.\r\n\r\nThe resolution states that PAUSD officials will not cooperate with immigration enforcement actions unless specifically required to do so by law, but will not interfere with necessary action carried out by law enforcement. For instance, district staff must respond to questions about students from immigration officers, but will refer them first to the\u00a0Supt. or his designee, \u201cunless there is an immediate threat to public safety.\u201d Additionally, the resolution states that \u201cPAUSD will not disclose personally identifiable information in a student's \u2018educational records\u2019 to outside agencies without written parental consent, judicial order, or lawfully-issued subpoena.\u201d\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the passing of this resolution, the Board of Education and Paly administration will be working together to ensure that PAUSD is a \u201csanctuar[y] for students to the fullest extent allowed by law,\u201d McGee said.<\/span>","excerpt":"During a school board meeting on Tuesday, the board approved a resolution that affirms PAUSD's support of immigrant students and families, and states PAUSD should be a sanctuary for students.","date":"2017-01-15 18:14:01","author":"Bianca Al-Shamari","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/schoolboard051016.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":["Board of Education","california valuea act","immigrants","Kevin de Leon","McGee","PAUSD","resolution","senate leader","Trump"]},{"id":127942,"title":"Slideshow: Paly girls dominate Mountain View","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2017\/01\/14\/slideshow-paly-girls-dominate-mountain-view\/","content":"The Palo Alto High School girls' basketball team (9-3, 3-0) continued their undefeated season in league play, defeating the Mountain View Spartans 61-47.\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/143ywtI4gQtX54hGMda6xvVbcNKNSIRIVwgrcAcNDaAA\/embed?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=3000\" width=\"650\" height=\"400\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe>","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School girls' basketball team (9-3, 3-0) continued their undefeated season in league play, defeating the Mountain View Spartans 61-47.\r\n\r\n","date":"2017-01-14 10:53:16","author":"Kasra Orumchian","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/IMG_85731.jpg","categories":["Slideshow","Sports"],"tags":["2016","basketball","carly leong","CCS","girls","gunn","juniors","new","palo alto","palo alto high school","paly","review","School","seniors","skylar burris","slideshow","sports","student","vikings"]},{"id":127849,"title":"Girls&#8217; soccer hopes to stay undefeated against Homestead","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2017\/01\/12\/girls-soccer-hopes-to-stay-undefeated-against-homestead\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_127359\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"596\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/IMG_7891.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-127359\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/IMG_7891.jpg\" alt=\"Senior midfielder Talia Malchin passes the ball upfield against Gunn in December.

Pirates, thieves, giants, royalty and a kidnapping all come together in this classic romantic comedy.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to junior Publicity Coordinator Nandini Relan, the TAC is comprised of a group of teenagers from the Palo Alto area who have a passion for art and wish to share that enthusiasm with the student population. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe plan all sorts of events throughout the year, [such as] recurring open mics and poetry slams,\u201d Relan said. \u201cAll of these events are run almost entirely by high school students.\u201d <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to its focus on the arts, the TAC wishes to provide a place\u00a0for students to decompress through events such as this upcoming movie night. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe provide a safe space for teens to come and de-stress,\u201d Relan said. \u201cIt's a super happy environment to be in.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The event was originally planned for finals week, but was moved to this weekend to improve student attendance. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe decided this year that it may be easier to just do it [this Friday] when everyone can just relax more fully and seniors are mostly done with applications,\u201d Dinu said. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The TAC encourages students of all backgrounds and interests to come.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cA lot of the time, people think it's just us in Teen Arts Council or just our close group of friends,\u201d Dinu said. \u201cBut a huge reason why we have this event [movie night] is to bring people from different backgrounds together to meet and just relax together and have a fun evening.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\nFor those who can't make it to this Friday's event, the TAC will also be hosting a poetry slam on Jan. 27, and an open mic night on\u00a0Feb. 10, according to Relan.","excerpt":"The Teen Arts Council will host a movie night as its first event of the year at 7 p.m. on Friday, at the Mitchell Park Center.","date":"2017-01-12 09:27:27","author":"Maya Reuven","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/IMG_0783.jpg","categories":["Uncategorized"],"tags":["friday","friday the 13th","movie night","tac","the princess bride"]}]
