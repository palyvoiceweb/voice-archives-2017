(Flex, in this case, is not the same as the Flex period listed on Paly's Tuesday afternoon schedule, which was formerly referred to as Tutorial.)\r\n\r\nFormer Palo Alto High School Teacher on Special Assignment and the current Coordinator for Educational Technology and Libraries at the district level, Emily Garrison, explains that blended learning is a push for moving education into the 21st century.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe now know that in the 21st century, living in the information age, learning doesn\u2019t happen like it used to in the past. You have a phone in your pocket that has access to the entirety of humanity\u2019s knowledge,\" Garrison said. \"That 19th century model of the teacher being the center of knowledge just doesn\u2019t make sense anymore. Does learning have to be confined to third period? No, absolutely not. You all can go do your school work in many places and at a time that works best for you. Or, you can stay on campus and work more closely with your teacher in a small group.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Garrison, the concept of blended learning is approximately a decade old, but only reached Palo Alto Unified School District in 2009, when Gunn High school history teacher Brian Tuomy decided to experiment with a new type of class. This first class, now referred to as a \u201cTwilight blended class,\u201d met every Wednesday evenings for two and a half to three hours, giving the participating students a prep period during the school day. Garrison explains that when the students were not in class, \u201cthey used Schoology to do work at their own path, place and location, for however long it took them to complete the work.\u201d\r\n\r\nGarrison explains that Tuomy then became the first blended learning TOSA, and decided to start a training program.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn 2011, he got together the first cohort of Gunn and Paly teachers, all of whom volunteered to be a part of an intense 60-hour certification program,\u201d Garrison said. \u201cThey completed something called \u2018The Leading Edge Certification Program,' which is basically a training program for teachers that want to start teaching in more of an online modality.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe second cohort, which ran in fall 2013, switched training programs in order to get a better understanding of how to use Schoology for the purpose of blended learning.\r\n\r\n\u201cUnlike the first cohort that was composed of mostly Gunn teachers, this second cohort was pretty evenly mixed,\u201d Garrison said. \u201cThis time we decided to complete another training program with an outside instructor, but we did everything through Schoology. This was so powerful because teachers were essentially students on Schoology, so we could experience what it would be like for our students.\u201d\r\n\r\nRight after Garrison became the blended learning TOSA, she decided with Tuomy that they would be creating their own certification program.\r\n\r\n\u201cBrian Tuomy and I used our experience in blended learning in Palo Alto and we created our own Schoology training course,\u201d Garrison said. \u201cIt still exists today, and it keeps getting better every year.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Garrison, Tuomy stepped down as the Gunn TOSA before the fifth cohort and was replaced with Gunn's Chris Bell, a math and computer science teacher.\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Bell and I have now worked with approximately 65 teachers that are trained in blended learning in the district,\u201d Garrison said. \u201cIn the spring we have a \u2018Blended Learning Symposium,\u2019 where all the teachers come together and learn from one another\u2019s experiences.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Garrison, not all teachers who complete the training program end up running blended classes.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have found that it works really well if we run this training program in the spring, and then over the course of the entire following year, the teachers that participated can experiment with different levels of blended learning in their classroom,\u201d Garrison said. \u201cWhen that year is over, teachers can decide if they want to informally continue to use blended learning concepts, or if they want their following year\u2019s class to be a formal blended course, otherwise known as a \u2018full-release\u2019 course. To be listed as a full-release course, the only requirement is that online coursework does not to exceed 49 percent of the course time.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, whether or not a blended learning class runs is completely up to the students.\r\n\r\n\"There have been teachers that have wanted to teach blended classes, who have prepared for them, and then it just doesn't work out,\" Garrison said. \"For a blended course to run, it has to be published in the course catalog, and just like any other class, it has to have enough students register.\"","excerpt":"Just like chefs, teachers of blended learning classes are handed a basic recipe for success, and then given the opportunity to add their own unique twist to the process.","date":"2017-02-15 22:50:29","author":"Daniella Maydan","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/Blended-learning.jpg","categories":["Features","Spotlight"],"tags":["21st century learning","blended learning","brian tui","chris bell","cohort","emily garrison","PAUSD","twilight classes"]},{"id":129565,"title":"Fifteen blended courses to be offered next year","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2017\/02\/15\/fifteen-blended-courses-to-be-offered-next-year\/","content":"<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Assistant Principal Victoria Kim, Paly will be offering 15 <a href=\"http:\/\/paly.io\/v\/125499\">blended classes<\/a> next year.

You may have seen me around campus with a San Jose Sharks beanie or jersey on because that's what most of my apparel consists of. Hockey is interesting to me because of the history and tradition that is connected with it. Last month I had the wonderful opportunity to attend a centennial celebration of the National Hockey League at the SAP Center, home of the Sharks.<\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The year 2017 marks the NHL\u2019s 100th year of existence. To celebrate this event, the NHL organized Centennial Fan Arenas in NHL cities in both the United States and Canada. The tour lasts from January through December.<\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The San Jose Sharks are the first NHL team to participate in this touring tribute. Our local celebration was a favorite for hockey fans and also a great way to introduce hockey to those who don\u2019t know much about the game and its history. The celebration included responsive games and multiple free giveaways with appearances from Sharkie, the Sharks mascot, and the team's cheerleaders.<\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The main attraction was a 53-foot museum truck with an innovative interior featuring more than 1,000 square feet of interactive digital displays, videos, historical memorabilia and unique photo opportunities. A high-tech feature of the tour was the Clear The Ice Zamboni VR Experience. This never-before-seen VR experience allowed\u00a0fans to compete against each other in a race to resurface the ice. Fans could also take a seat in a mini-Zamboni ice resurfacer, feel cool air on their skin and rumble in their seats as they attempted to make a\u00a0perfect sheet of ice \u2014 in virtual reality. All fans were allowed to race, were timed and shared on a leaderboard for everyone to see.<\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The most memorable feature of the event was the appearance of the Stanley Cup: one of the oldest and most revered trophies in professionals sports. The trophy was displayed at the Centennial Fan Arena where visitors took photos with it. Standing next to the cup, seeing the names of all the players and teams who won it, had a profound effect on me. The greatest players ever to play the game had raised this same trophy.<\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">According to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.quanthockey.com\/nhl\/us-state\/active-nhl-players-born-in-california-career-stats.html\">Quanth Hockey website<\/a>, which provides hockey statistics on NHL records and locations of every player's birth cities and states. It shows that relative to other sports in the area, hockey is not as popular a sport in California, based on the number of players drafted into the NHL from the state. Hockey fans are primarily located on the East Coast and throughout Canada because of their snowy winters.<\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On the other hand, because of the success of the Sharks, Anaheim Ducks and Los Angeles Kings, fans around the world are starting to recognize the hockey fandom in California and the passion that many Californians feel about the game and their teams. Because of these teams, younger hockey players from California will have certain players they look up to and\u00a0could eventually make it to NHL themselves.<\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Last year, the Sharks went on their best run in franchise history, with their fans behind them the whole way, and after making it to the NHL Stanley Cup Finals, were within reach of the cup. The Sharks were ultimately stopped short of their dream by the Pittsburgh Penguins, who defeated them in six games in the best-of-seven series. Winning the trophy continues to be on the Sharks' mind and winning it in the 100th anniversary of the NHL would be a very memorable one.<\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The SAP event\u00a0was an example of the potential of hockey in California. Ambassadors of the sport are reaching out to Californians by teaching them about the tradition and history of the game. This interest will not change overnight, and tomorrow most Californians won't be worried about the next hockey game they will attend; however, this historic event is a sign that hockey in California is trending upward.<\/p>","excerpt":"The year 2017 marks the NHL\u2019s 100th year of existence.

Photo by: David Hickey[\/caption]\r\n\r\nDuring the 2016 off-season, the Paly boys' basketball team (19-3, 10-0) acquired five-foot-10-inch junior shooting guard Jared Wulbrun, who had just moved from Birmingham, Alabama.\u00a0Wulbrun scored 24 points in his first regular season game as a Viking, hitting six of seven three-point shots and six of seven shots from the free-throw line. Wulbrun's sharpshooting along with his court vision and high basketball IQ, will be essential as the Vikings finish out league play this week.\r\n\r\nThe\u00a0Wulbrun\u00a0family\u00a0ventured to the west coast because Jared's father, Jeff Wulbrun, accepted a job offer at Stanford University as the head assistant coach for the men's basketball team.\r\n\r\nBasketball has been a passion for Jared Wulbrun for as long as he can remember. Moving to Palo Alto, he had mixed emotions about having to assimilate to his current team.\r\n\r\n\"My first impressions were varied coming from a team that won a state title last year. I wasn't sure what the season would be like, honestly,\" Wulbrun said. \"It's always a hard thing to come into a new school, a new team, and expect everything to go smoothly. I was playing for a starting job which means you're going against others on the team for one or two spots, which can cause problems. For the most part there were no issues or hard feelings between any of us, which did nothing but help the team chemistry grow.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the preseason, Wulbrun first played with the team in an out-of-state tournament and quickly realized the strength that the team possesses.\r\n\r\n\"I soon figured out that we had something special with our group,\" Wulbrun said. \"I came [to Palo Alto]\u00a0this summer and was able to play with the team in their summer tournaments and in our second tournament in Reno, Nevada. I saw what we had the potential to accomplish this year.\"\r\n\r\nWulbrun credits senior captain and point-guard Miles Tention for making his transition smoother than he expected.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_129555\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"394\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/jared-3.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-129555\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/jared-3.jpg\" alt=\"Wulbrun launches a three-point shot against Oak Grove High School.

My thought was that 'We\u00a0could only go up from here.'\"\r\n\r\nAccording to junior forward William Schlemmer, Wulbrun has had an impact on the team as a knock-down three-point shooter as well as a great friend.\r\n\r\n\"He's pretty much become family since I met him because he moved here over the summer and got a chance to get familiar with everyone else on the team and he's a great person to have around on and off the court,\" junior forward Will Schlemmer said. \"He's a good shooter and hustler so he's willing to do the little things to get the job done.\"\r\n\r\nHaving clinched the top seed in the De Anza League, the team looks to continue their dominance against its toughest and most anticipated league opponent of the season, the Los Gatos High School Wildcats (16-6, 6-4), who currently sit in second place in the league, at 7 p.m. on Tuesday at Gunn High School. The two teams met earlier in the season, with the Vikings dismissing their arch-rivals in an intense, 66-57, victory.\r\n\r\nDuring the his first taste of the Paly-Los Gatos feud, Wulbrun poured in 17-points, 12 of which came from beyond the arch. According to Wulbrun, he felt the intensity of the matchup and is keen to bring the heat on Tuesday.\r\n\r\n\"I've heard that at Paly, most people aren't very fond of [Los] Gatos,\" Wulbrun said. \"The first game showed that. We\u00a0need to come out on Tuesday with the same mindset that we did at their place a few weeks ago. It's also senior night, and I know we all want to send our four seniors out the right way:\u00a0at home with a huge [win] over a rival.\"\r\n\r\nTuesday's game is Paly's annual basketball \"Senior night,\" where seniors<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Tention, Jack Simison, Ethan Stern and Eelis Copeland will be honored.<\/span>\r\n\r\nFor Paly, the key to stopping the strong Los Gatos\u00a0squad is limiting the play of Wildcat six-foot-six-inch junior forward Dylan Belquist.\u00a0Belquist was named to the De Anza League first team last year as a sophomore and dunked over six-foot-five-inch tall Schlemmer for two of his 20 points the last time the two teams met.\r\n\r\n\"We\u00a0just need to play our game and make sure to not give them second chances on the offensive glass,\" Schlemmer said. \"As for Dylan we just want to play as a team and have someone besides him beat us. These next two [league] games are extremely important. One of our goals this year is to go undefeated in league and we are close to achieving that goal.\"","excerpt":"A good amount of the students attending Palo Alto High School have lived in or around the city of Palo Alto for most of, if not all, their lives. For those who haven't, they know that transitioning to a new home can be tough. Having new teachers, making new friends, being in a new environment, and getting involved in new sports teams and school organizations can be a very difficult transition.

She also says she appreciates how many resources and opportunities are offered to students.\r\n\r\n\u201cEveryone seems to be encouraged to do more than just STEM, so there seems to be a lot of cross-studying which is good for [students],\u201d Smiley said.\r\n\r\nBefore joining Paly\u2019s staff this year, Smiley taught for a year in China with her fellowship program in college and then began more one-on-one teaching, according to Smiley.\r\n\r\nSmiley didn\u2019t always know she wanted to be a teacher until she studied abroad in Germany through Wellesley College.\r\n\r\n\u201cAs I was there, I helped some other students in the classes and discovered that I really enjoy teaching,\u201d Smiley said. \u201cWhen I got back, I took an [education] course on a whim and figured out this is something I really want to do.\u201d\r\n\r\nNow, Smiley balances working at Paly while also earning her graduate degree at Stanford University.\r\n\r\n\u201cI come to Paly and I'm here all day until about 2:45,\u201d Smiley said. \u201cThen I go to Stanford and I have classes from about 3p.m. to 6p.m. and I go home.\u201d\r\n\r\nOutside of the classroom classrooms, Smiley enjoys playing video games, hiking and walking the Dish, according to Smiley.\r\n\r\nBefore choosing to become a teacher, Smiley was doing research focusing on lifespan psychology in Germany and hopes to teach a Psychology class in the future.","excerpt":"The Paly Voice sat down with Palo Alto High School Social Science teacher in training Katie Smiley and discussed her passions outside of the classroom, as well as her current busy schedule between teaching and her own education.","date":"2017-02-13 09:53:32","author":"Aisha Chabane","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/16237573_613586045492637_309238746_n.jpg","categories":["Coffee chats","Lifestyle","Spotlight"],"tags":["coffee chats","economics","psychology","Smiley","social justice","stanford","Teaching","Wellesley College"]},{"id":129462,"title":"Students to unleash their inner artists at Teen Creativity Party","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2017\/02\/09\/students-to-unleash-their-inner-artist-at-teen-creativity-party\/","content":"The Palo Alto Art Center will host its second Takeover Teen Creativity Party from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m.\u00a0tomorrow at the Palo Alto Art Center.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Palo Alto High School junior event co-runner Anna Fuller is organizing the party, which she says is a way to bring teens together.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe created this [party] to bring Palo Alto teens together and integrate art into the Palo Alto community,\u201d Fuller said. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the Takeover Teen Creativity Party flyer, the event will include art making, music, games and a photo booth. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fuller encourages all teens to come and enjoy the various activities, including henna. <\/span>\r\n\r\n\u201cThere are going to be henna artists there who can decorate your arms with beautiful designs,\u201d Fuller said.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Fuller, it is important for teens to unleash their creative side through art.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI think it\u2019s important for teens to do art because I feel like at an early age students learn more science and math skills and it isn\u2019t really promoted in school to do artistic things,\" Fuller said. \"Letting teens do art and creative things is good for promoting creativity and brings a community of teens together.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Fuller, the event is free and snacks will be provided.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\nJunior Mele Mahe is excited to be creative and have fun.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201c[I] can\u2019t wait to see pretty art and find out what the party\u2019s all about,\u201d Mahe said. <\/span>\r\n\r\nCreated by teens for teens, RSVP on the teen arts Facebook page <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/events\/393813334288990\/\" target=\"_blank\">Takeover: Teen Creativity Party!<\/a>","excerpt":"The Palo Alto Art Center will host its second Takeover Teen Creativity Party from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. this Friday at the Palo Alto Art Center.","date":"2017-02-09 22:10:45","author":"Leila Chabane","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/takeover-photo-1-11.jpg","categories":["News"],"tags":["art","palo alto art center","palo alto high school","paly","Party"]},{"id":129465,"title":"Teen Advisory Board to host Cupcake Wars","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2017\/02\/09\/teen-advisory-board-to-host-cupcake-wars\/","content":"Interested in competing in a tasty challenge tomorrow night?

According to former elementary school teacher Erika Papakipos, who was a part of the demonstration, the group's goal was to encourage community members to speak up against DeVos and other appointments of the Trump adminstration. \"We're trying to let people know that we're not alone and that people should get out here and fight the normalization of outrageous cabinet picks and appointments,\" Papakipos said. Photo: William Sallomi.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe Tuesday confirmation of Betsy DeVos as Secretary of Education unsettled the Palo Alto Unified School District superintendent, Paly\u00a0teachers and the wider PAUSD community, a concern that initially sparked\u00a0after her remarks during the Senate hearing.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DeVos, a billionaire who hails from the Michigan elite, is widely known for her advocacy for school choice, a policy that<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0offers financial incentive for students to attend K-12 schools outside of the public school system.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Supporters of DeVos argue that her anti-regulation philosophy will provide students and their families with more independence and therefore better options. On the other hand, her critics assert that her exclusive work with non-public schools and narrow focus on charter and religious schools disqualify her from the position.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PAUSD Supt. Max McGee says he is unsettled by\u00a0the negative outlook on public education DeVos has expressed throughout the confirmation process.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cMs. DeVos may be very intelligent and she\u2019s certainly very wealthy, but I think she has a lot to learn about public education and leadership,\u201d McGee said.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DeVos has remained consistent on one of her signature policies, privatizing public schools, which has drawn criticism from public school officials nationwide. According to McGee, transferring public education funds into the private sector would prove to be a dangerous move.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cAssuming that privatization is going to make a difference for our most needy and, in many cases, our most deserving students, is misinformed,\u201d McGee\u00a0said.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the most memorable moments of DeVos' Senate hearing came when Sen. Tim Kaine, a Democrat from Virginia, asked DeVos if she believed all schools that receive taxpayer funding \u2013 public, public charter and private \u2013 should be equally accountable, and <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.c-span.org\/video\/?c4648121\/tim-kaine-betsy-devos\">DeVos eventually replied \u201cwell, no<\/a>.\" In stark contrast,\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">McGee said that PAUSD will strive to be\u00a0a national model for accountability, and\u00a0hopes others will follow suit.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI think in her heart of hearts, Ms. DeVos understands the importance of accountability,\u201d McGee said. \u201cCertainly, business owners are accountable to their shareholders if they\u2019re going to stay in business, so I hope some of the things we do here in Palo Alto and other lighthouse districts across the country in terms of accountability could inform federal policy.\u201d <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Paly social science\u00a0teacher Caitlin Evans, DeVos\u2019 ideas\u00a0would undermine the current system. Diverting attention away from the struggles of public schools by providing the option of non-public schools would only worsen the current state of public schools, according to Evans.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThere will be a huge swath of the population that won\u2019t know they have the right to choose, or they don\u2019t have a school they can physically get to, so you end up with public schools that are underfunded,\u201d Evans said. \u201cThat\u2019s a concern that public school teachers have, that she [DeVos] is taking the emphasis away from public schools, and giving a buffet of options, and what that ultimately means is that those [public] schools get worse, because they lose funding, teachers and students.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Evans is not worried about the future of PAUSD, but she is worried about neighboring school districts that do not have the large amounts of funding that PAUSD has.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI\u2019m not too concerned about that issue in Palo Alto, but I know that the Oakland School District is really concerned about it,\u201d Evans\u00a0said, referencing the school choice policy. \u201cThey have a big population. They have a lot of charter schools and private schools and they are all competing for students. It puts the public schools in a really tight spot.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\nFor Duveneck Elementary School teacher Barbara Susco, DeVos severely lacks the experience to\u00a0control education at the federal level.\r\n\r\n\"She's not qualified to be the Education Secretary,\" Susco said. \"She has never handled a large budget and she has no experience with public schools.\"\r\n\r\nSusco, along with other community members, attended a protest\u00a0Monday afternoon\u00a0on the corner of El Camino Real and Embarcadero Rd. The group's goal was to inspire others to contact Republican senators and urge them to reconsider then-nominee DeVos, according to Susco.\r\n\r\nFormer Duveneck teacher Erika Papakipos joined Susco in participating in the demonstration. According to Papakipos, DeVos is dangerous and a threat to American education.\r\n\r\n\"I am concerned that having somebody that knows nothing about education and who has sort of an antipathy to public education is going to dismantle public education and further increase income inequality and opportunity inequality in this country,\" Papakipos said. \"I'm afraid that she [DeVos] would just move us in the wrong direction.\"\r\n\r\nPapakipos said she believes that the values and opinons of people in Palo Alto are threatened by DeVos's new role in the government, and that those who don't support her should make themselves heard.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paly senior Ibby Day has enjoyed her public school education and worries that school choice may negatively impact the diversity of public schools.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI think that attending public schools has opened me up to a more diverse range of people,\u201d Day said. \u201cI fear that DeVos' school choice plan might take away [some] types of people that attend public schools, which will cause the student population to be less diverse.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">McGee expressed an interest in working with DeVos by providing an example of a successful public education model.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI would love to have her join us in Palo Alto and see what a high quality education is like,\u201d McGee said. \u201cMaybe [we could] find ways [to] help inform policies that would have a positive impact on school districts across the country.\"<\/span>","excerpt":"The Tuesday confirmation of Betsy DeVos as Secretary of Education unsettled the Palo Alto Unified School District superintendent, Paly teachers and the wider PAUSD community, a concern that initially sparked after her remarks during the Senate hearing.","date":"2017-02-09 15:06:29","author":"Jevan Yu","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/SUSCO-4REAL1.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":["Betsy","cabinet","charter schools","confirmation","devos","education","evans","ibby day","max","McGee","Palo Alto Unified School District","public school","senate","united states"]}]
