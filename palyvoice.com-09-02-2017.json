Photo: Adrienne Kwok.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The newly-built Performing Arts Center is Palo Alto High School\u2019s newest landmark. With a grand total of 25,100 square feet that boasts a motorized orchestra pit and 582 seats, the PAC is a display of grandeur on Paly\u2019s campus. However, as of now, the PAC remains a closed-off resource that many Paly students find difficult to utilize.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since its <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2016\/10\/04\/performing-arts-center-formally-introduced\/\">grand opening<\/a> in October 2016, the PAC has held theater, choir, band and orchestra performances. However, one group that has found difficulty in reserving the PAC is Paly's very own Team 8 Robotics group. With approximately 83 students, Paly Robotics is one of the largest student organizations found on campus.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clubs at Paly have the option to rent out spaces such as the Media Arts Center to use for events.\u00a0The<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0robotics team recently intended to use the PAC for their kickoff day, to mark the beginning of their 6-week \u201cbuild season\u201d during which team members build a robot for competition, and also for their awards night, according to Head Coach Christopher Kuszmaul.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe PAC is an extremely valuable educational resource,\u201d Kuszmaul said. \u201cIt is my duty to make use of educational resources that are at my disposal. The PAC very much has my attention because I feel an obligation to the taxpayers who pay for this resource and if I don\u2019t use it, I am neglecting my duty.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Robotics students, including senior project manager Jonathan Zwiebel, expressed similar concern.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe issue isn\u2019t that they charge money, the issue is that most students have never been in the PAC, ever,\u201d Zwiebel said. \u201cMost students aren\u2019t ever allowed to go into the PAC. You shouldn\u2019t spend money on a building then not use it because you don\u2019t want it to get dirty. It should be like the MAC or the MRC [Math Resource Center] or the library where there are just people in there because it\u2019s an open space.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Assistant Principal of Operations Jerry Berkson, the PAC\u2019s schedule is packed with events, partly due to Gunn High School\u2019s Spangenberg Theater which is currently undergoing renovation.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201c[The PAC] is booked a lot because right now we are sharing because Gunn\u2019s theater is under renovation,\u201d Berkson said. \u201cWe will eventually rent it out to outside parties. We\u2019re not going to do that for at least the first year, and probably beyond that. \u2026 We've got two plays from us per year, two plays per year for Gunn, all the choir events [and] all the instrumentals. There's so much going on that there is not a lot of space.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Robotics is not alone in its struggle to utilize Paly\u2019s resources. During the winter season, Paly\u2019s wrestling team requested to use the PAC.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We wanted to use the PAC because we currently don't have a gym to use for our dual meets,\u201d said wrestling coach Ryan Kessler. \u201cOur home competitions are all at Gunn High School. When I told my team it was a possibility we would be wrestling in there, they were pretty fired up. I mostly feel bad for our seniors Seth Goyal and Sara Aguilar who will miss out on the new gym that's being built. It would have been nice to send them off with a home match at Paly.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are four different categories used to determine the charges for renting a Palo Alto Unified School District facility. District and school-sponsored clubs and groups are allowed to rent all district facilities, with the exception of pools, at no charge. Departments of local governments, community organizations with 501c3 (nonprofit) status, and government agencies that are not charging fees are all required to pay a fee for rental. Businesses and religious organizations must pay a fee higher than that of the aforementioned groups. The charge for camps is per week rather than per hour.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The rental charge per hour is also dependent on the room or field one wishes to rent, with a greater charge for larger spaces.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A calendar delineating the PAC, Haymarket Theater and Gunn\u2019s Spangenberg Theater schedules may be found <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/spangenbergtheatre.org\/productioncalendar.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span>\r\n\r\nThe robotics team is looking forward to the PAC being available for more students to use.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Kuszmaul, \u201cthe PAC seems to be like the guest towels that nobody can use because we might make them dirty.\u201d<\/span>","excerpt":"The newly-built Performing Arts Center is Palo Alto High School\u2019s newest landmark.

Menlo-Atherton senior guard Eric Norton,\u00a0who scored a game-high 22 points, led the charge for the Bears and netted seven points in the second quarter. The Bears dominated the latter parts of the second period and the teams headed into halftime knotted at 28-28.\r\n\r\nThe second half started no better than the first half ended.

Indeed, I had forgotten about this, and about a lot of other aspects of life as a PE student. I\u2019d forgotten the feeling of my polyester PE shorts riding up on my waist as I ran the compulsory two warm-up laps on the track. I\u2019d forgotten the atmosphere of a high school locker room and the dread I\u2019d feel when my PE teacher announced we had a mile run coming up. Along with the things I\u2019d forgotten, there were new strategies to getting through a semester with sophomore classmates that I had yet to learn.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Physical Education at Palo Alto High School is required for four semesters. Typically, students enroll in PE during their freshman and sophomore years. I, however, injured my knee in the\u00a0second semester of my sophomore year, and decided to fulfill the remainder of my PE requirement first semester of my senior year. According to PE teacher Jacob Halas, there are about two or three seniors per year taking PE, usually due to injury or failure of the class. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was one of those seniors, and these are phases of my journey as a student in Halas\u2019 third period PE class.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<b>Phase One: I hate fitness testing, my life is a joke<\/b>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_128999\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"339\"]<img class=\"wp-image-128999\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/IMG_44601.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_4460\" width=\"339\" height=\"254\" \/> Sophomore PE students perform the push-up test. Unfortunately, the photo does not show the electronic push-up counting contraptions that never fail to elicit grievances from students. Photo: Emily Hwang.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I had a number of gripes, right off the bat. The temporary locker room situation meant a smaller number of lockers in the locker room and that I couldn\u2019t keep my clothes and shoes there between classes. The gray PE shirt and green shorts combo was\u00a0an outfit I was not proud (read: humiliated) to don, especially when I ran into fellow seniors on my walk from the locker room\u00a0to the track. When people asked what my next class would be, my reply of \"PE\" always received a hearty chuckle, a sympathetic \"I'm sorry\" and a question:\u00a0\"Why?\".<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first few weeks as a senior in PE consisted of fitness testing, during which each day brought another form of cruelty. There were both the old favorites, like the mile and push-ups, and new inventions of the PE Department such as the Viking and Figure 8 runs. Thankfully, after fitness testing ended I got my fall sport prep.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<b>Phase Two: I have no friends in this class, but do I want to be friends with sophomores anyway?\u00a0<\/b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The golf team\u2019s failure to advance past the NorCal stage of postseason not only resulted in the end of my high school golf career, it meant that I would have to go back to PE. There was another senior in my class at the beginning of the semester, but soon enough she desperately sought out (and succeeded in finding) an alternative to her PE requirement. I was forced to face the daunting sea of underclassmen on my own.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Honestly, I did very little to be sociable in that class, and so I did more listening to the sophomores than talking. \u00a0The worst was when they mentioned college. I was drowning in college applications and these toddlers had the audacity to complain about not knowing which school to apply to early? In fact, it seemed like sophomores moaned and groaned about every single thing we did in that class, especially when they didn\u2019t get their preps as fast as they wanted to. They reeked of immaturity and even worse, reminded me of\u00a0what my life was like two years ago. Though I must admit, Algebra 2 and Chemistry stressed me out too.<\/span>\r\n\r\nIn addition, I regularly saw them outside of class, painful reminders of my\u00a0PE life. You know <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2017\/01\/30\/invasion-of-the-arts-art-in-unusual-places\/\" target=\"_blank\">Arts in Unusual Places<\/a>? It was like\u00a0that, except replace the art with sophomores, and the unusual part was recognizing underclassmen in unusual places. (Note: my attitude about this has changed. See next phase.)\r\n\r\n<b>Phase Three: Actually, sophomores aren\u2019t that bad I guess<\/b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A few instances of kindness from sophomores stick out in my mind when I think of my time in PE. First, when I returned to class after golf season, a particularly nice sophomore introduced herself to me when she noticed my unfamiliar presence. It felt good to be welcomed with a smile.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On a separate occasion, as I was kicking around the weird rubber pellets of the lacrosse field turf waiting for the PE teachers to show up, a couple of girls signaled me to approach them. I was confused at first. I glanced around. <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Me? Are they gesturing at me?<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Seeing as there was no one else in my immediate vicinity, I concluded that there was no other possibility. We started conversing and I revealed my plight to them. In general, I think most of the sophomores had sympathy for me when they realized I was a senior. I was like a poor, misunderstood alien creature trying to navigate a new world and they were the altruistic humans attempting to help me adjust.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plus, the evasive tactics my classmates used in PE were entertaining. One girl in my class hid in the bathroom almost every time we had to run. Another group of students started walking their warm-up laps before the PE teachers got to the track, so that they would have less distance to run once the teachers did show up. Ingenius.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<b>Phase Four: Hey, PE can be pretty fun and I Am A Champion<\/b>\r\n\r\nIf nothing else, one tangible accomplishment did come out of this: I am proudly a member of the winning team of the 3rd period sophomore PE softball tournament. Yes, I know you\u2019re jealous. The other (losing) sophomores were, because our team got to sit out of an extensive bleacher run the next day. I sat and watched as panting sophomores trudged past me, and I couldn\u2019t help but revel in the sweet, sweet victory.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_128998\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"312\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/IMG_4464-12.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-128998\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/IMG_4464-12.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_4464 (1)\" width=\"312\" height=\"234\" \/><\/a> PE teacher Jacob Halas observes his students playing lacrosse. None of us really got the cradling technique down in such a short period of time. Photo: Emily Hwang.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nOften, we would warm up and then play a sport for the rest of the period, which I found greatly enjoyable.\u00a0We tackled lacrosse, a sport most of us had never played before. As a whole, our skills were wonderfully, hilariously mediocre.\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a lot of ways, PE made me feel like a kid again. It\u2019s difficult to organize a large group of people with the equipment necessary to play sports and games. In PE, I had the opportunity to do that every other day, which I was surprisingly grateful for.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over time, I recognized that participating in PE as a senior was not significantly different from being a sophomore in PE. I had a chat with PE teacher Jason Fung about this, and he reflected on the attitude of PE students and the goals of teachers in this unique subject. It\u2019s really just a state of mind, according to\u00a0Fung. Athletes will come into PE with the mindset of wanting to succeed. I didn't really care about being the best at PE, but I did\u00a0attempt to be optimistic about it.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<b>Phase Five: Bye, PE! Advice from me to you, underclassmen<\/b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As finals week rolled around, so did my official last week of high school PE.\u00a0Granted, I hesitate to say that I miss PE, though it did force me to reflect on the growth I've experienced in the past two years of my life. It's incredible how much you can learn in two years, really. So, as a senior and participant in PE for eight-ish weeks, I feel validated in telling underclassmen a few things.<\/span>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_129000\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"324\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/IMG_44441.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-129000\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/IMG_44441.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_4444\" width=\"324\" height=\"250\" \/><\/a> PE teacher Jacob Halas flashes a thumbs-up at his students during their warm-up. Fun fact: Halas temporarily lost my prep contract at the start of the semester and I was irate. It's okay, he found it later and never wronged me again. Photo: Emily Hwang.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dear freshmen and sophomores, please remember that the PE teachers really aren\u2019t trying to torture you. According to Fung, all they want to do is give you the tools to live a healthier life and teach you to value fitness. Those seem like noble goals to me. Yeah, running isn't the best, but think of PE as a much-needed break from your normal schoolwork, a chance to get some fresh air and socialize with your peers. PE isn\u2019t worth having a bad attitude about. You\u2019ll never have any fun if you focus on how much better life would be if you had a prep.<\/span>\r\n\r\nThank you, to the sophomores who showed me compassion and played sports with me, and to my merciful PE teachers. PE wasn't all that bad.","excerpt":"It's not often that seniors have to take PE...","date":"2017-02-02 22:36:39","author":"Emily Hwang","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/IMG_44451.jpg","categories":["Opinion","Opinion Editor's Pick","Spotlight"],"tags":["column","experience","fun","halas","learning","misery","pe","senior","Sophomores"]},{"id":129090,"title":"New clubs to spot at second semester Club Day","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2017\/02\/02\/new-clubs-to-spot-at-second-semester-club-day\/","content":"<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/Screenshot-2017-02-02-at-10.31.49-AM.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-129134\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/Screenshot-2017-02-02-at-10.31.49-AM.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2017-02-02 at 10.31.49 AM\" width=\"600\" height=\"401\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nWith second semester's Club Day coming up tomorrow, students will be looking to join clubs, but may not know of the new clubs offered on campus in 2017.

You will also learn discipline: having to get out of bed when your alarm goes off in the middle of winter for 6\u00a0a.m. weights and biking\u00a0across Davis in the rain. Furthermore, one of the biggest things I learned was resilience: having to show up to practice the day after an extremely tough loss and ready to work even harder. Lastly, you will learn how to be a team player: you want to work as hard as you can for your teammates; after all, you will win together and lose together.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\nWhitson encouraged the athletes to enjoy the journey and to\u00a0not be afraid to reach out for help.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"Remember that you guys aren\u2019t alone in this adventure,\" Whitson said. \"Never hesitate to reach out to the people around you.

Trump during his first week in the Oval Office.\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/the-press-office\/2017\/01\/2\/executive-order-minimizing-economic-burden-patient-protection-and\">Affordable Care Act:<\/a><\/strong>\r\n\r\nThe president's first executive order was passed on the day of his inauguration, which is a relatively vague order aiming to \"minimize the economic burden\" of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\r\n\r\nIt begins with President Trump declaring that his administration will work to replace and repeal the act. The order itself is intended to reduce costs of the Affordable Care Act until this replacement occurs.\r\n\r\nWashington executives with authority under the act, such as\u00a0 have the power to \"waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision or requirement of the Act that would impose a fiscal burden on any State or a cost, fee, tax, penalty, or regulatory burden on individuals, families, healthcare providers, health insurers, patients, recipients of healthcare services, purchasers of health insurance, or makers of medical devices, products, or medications.\"\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/the-press-office\/2017\/01\/24\/executive-order-expediting-environmental-reviews-and-approvals-high\">Environmental Reviews and Infrastructure:<\/a><\/strong>\r\n\r\nTrump's next executive order was passed four days later, this time \"expediting environmental reviews and approvals for high priority infrastructure projects.\" Trump identifies the purpose of the order as an effort to increase the efficiency of decisions to promote infrastructure investment in order\u00a0to grow the American economy.\r\n\r\nThe president aims to expedite the process by implementing a 30-day period following a project's proposal, during which time the importance will be determined. If it is deemed to be highly beneficial to the \"general welfare\" of the nation, it will be labeled as a \"high priority.\"\r\n\r\nThe Chairman of the Council of Environmental Quality and the head of the relevant agency will then design \"expedited procedures and deadlines\" for the completion of environmental reviews and approvals of \"high priority\" projects.\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/the-press-office\/2017\/01\/25\/presidential-executive-order-enhancing-public-safety-interior-united\">Sanctuary Cities:<\/a><\/strong>\r\n\r\nOn Jan. 25, Trump issued another executive order that addresses sanctuary cities, which violate federal law by shielding undocumented immigrants from deportation.\r\n\r\nTrump introduces the order by stating \"The purpose of this order is to direct executive departments and agencies (agencies) to employ all lawful means to enforce the immigration laws of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nThe action will also \"ensure that jurisdictions that fail to comply with applicable Federal law do not receive Federal funds, except as mandated by law.\"\r\n\r\nTrump also emphasizes his desire for government agencies to utilize \"all available resources\" in ensuring that immigration laws and regulations are followed without exception.\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/the-press-office\/2017\/01\/25\/executive-order-border-security-and-immigration-enforcement-improvements\">Illegal Immigration\/The Wall:<\/a><\/strong>\r\n\r\nPresident Trump's next executive order, which was issued on Jan. 25, was intended to reduce the strain on both federal resources and federal organizations responsible for maintaining border security. Trump specifically names illegal immigration across the southern border as the cause of this strain. In line with one of President Trump's most notable campaign promises, this executive order begins the process of constructing a wall on America's border with Mexico.\r\n\r\nThe action's most notable component is the process to \"secure the southern border of the United States through the immediate construction of a physical wall on the southern border, monitored and supported by adequate personnel so as to prevent illegal immigration, drug and human trafficking, and acts of terrorism.\"\r\n\r\nThe order also pushes government agencies to speed up the process of determining the eligibility of a person detained on suspicion of violating US immigration policy.\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/the-press-office\/2017\/01\/27\/executive-order-protecting-nation-foreign-terrorist-entry-united-states\">Restriction on Immigration\/Travel:<\/a><\/strong>\r\n\r\nOn Jan. 27, Trump passed an executive order which implements a \"Suspension of Issuance of Visas and Other Immigration Benefits to Nationals of Countries of Particular Concern.\" These countries include Iraq, Iran, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Somalia and Libya.\r\n\r\nTrump also ordered that for a 90 day period, \"immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of aliens\" from these 7 countries will be restricted. Foreign nationals traveling on certain diplomatic visas will be exempt from this restriction.\r\n\r\nTravelers who are detained are subject to vetting and investigation. Once they have been evaluated, the travelers will be either be permitted access to the country or denied it, depending on whether or not they can be confirmed as peaceful.\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/the-press-office\/2017\/01\/28\/executive-order-ethics-commitments-executive-branch-appointees\">Ethics Pledge:<\/a><\/strong>\r\n\r\nThe president issued yet another executive order on Jan. 28, consisting of nine major ethical commitments which the members of his executive branch must uphold. These commitments range from preventing members of his cabinet from participating in certain lobbying activities, to keeping members of his cabinet from being influenced by lobbyists during their service.\r\n\r\nThe order also mandates that the members of his cabinet carefully read and then sign the document.\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/the-press-office\/2017\/01\/27\/executive-order-protecting-nation-foreign-terrorist-entry-united-states\">Government Regulation of Business:<\/a><\/strong>\r\n\r\nOn Jan. 28, the president passed an executive order impacting federal regulation of business. This executive order requires a minimum of two previously existing governmental regulations of business to be proposed for elimination whenever a new policy is implemented. It is in line with his \"one in two out\" campaign promise.\r\n\r\nTrump declared that that it \"is important that for every one new regulation issued, at least two prior regulations be identified for elimination, and that the cost of planned regulations be prudently managed and controlled through a budgeting process.\"\r\n\r\nThis executive order specifically affects the \"fiscal year 2017, which is in progress\". This statement restricts the longevity of the order to the end of this fiscal year.\r\n\r\nThe order also mandates that \"the total incremental cost\" of\u00a0 all new regulations, including repealed regulations, finalized in 2017 cannot exceed zero, unless otherwise required by law or if advised by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (Director).\r\n\r\nTrump has had a very busy first week, and this will not be the end of his actions as president.
