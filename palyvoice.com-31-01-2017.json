Playing in his second consecutive season on the Palo Alto High School boys' basketball team (16-2, 7-0), Rojahn and\u00a0fellow three-point juggernaut junior guard\u00a0Jared Wulbrun, have become the \"splash brothers\" of the Paly team. Rojahn provided the spark to the Vikings' domination of the Gunn High School Titans' basketball team (11-7, 2-5) on Friday, 79-36, hitting a couple three-pointers in the opening minutes, electrifying the crowd and setting the tone for the rest of the night.\u00a0With half of the regular season in the books, the Vikings remain the top dogs in the De Anza League.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_128729\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"475\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/spencer-celebrating.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-128729\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/spencer-celebrating.jpg\" alt=\"Junior guard Spencer Rojahn gets pumped up by fellow junior guard Brey Johnson pregame.

Rojahn hit two early three-pointers on Friday against Gunn High School. Photo: Rachel Code[\/caption]\r\n\r\nOver the course of play, Paly's swarming defense proved to be too much to handle for the Titans. Midway through the second quarter, Paly scored on three consecutive stolen passes and did not\u00a0allow the Gunn offense to pass the half-court line during those three possessions. A combination of the\u00a0Viking starting lineups' average height of just under six foot three inches and\u00a0a strong press defense enabled Paly to play at its desired game tempo and forced countless Titan turnovers.\r\n\r\nTo accompany the exceptional play of the starting lineup, \u00a0junior point guard Will Schmutz subbed in for senior starting point guard and team captain Miles Tention in the second half and excited the crowd with 11 points of his own. \"MVP\" chants erupted from the Paly sections following each of Schmutz's baskets. Also off the bench, junior guard Brey Johnson, junior center Bryant Jefferson, senior point guard Ethan Stern and senior guard Jack Simison added to the insurmountable Viking lead with a combined 25 points off the bench. Johnson added the exclamation point on the blowout win with a huge block on a Gunn guard during the closing minutes of the game.\r\n\r\nThe Titans struggled to find their groove on offense, ending the game without a double-digit scorer. Gunn senior forward Jeffery Lee-Heidenreich led the Titans with nine points, and senior guard Josh Radin poured in six of his own.\r\n\r\nPaly head coach Peter Diepenbrock said the Vikings' continued dominance has played a large factor in the team's mindset moving forward.\r\n\r\n\"We've won eight games\u00a0in a row and we keep improving so it's huge,\" Diepenbrock said. \"This win reconfirms what we're trying to do and it shows that we're going in the right direction.\"\r\n\r\nDespite the lengthy winning streak, Diepenbrock has seen this story before and said the team needs to remain grounded after its successes. Last season, the Vikings headed into the Central Coast Section playoffs having won the majority of the match-ups leading up the first round of CCS\u00a0but\u00a0were defeated in the first round.\r\n\r\n\"That's the challenge,\" Diepenbrock said. \"We have to be a much more mature team. Last year we couldn't handle this so hopefully we will keep practicing hard and keep our focus because we have bigger goals than just to win the league.\"\r\n\r\nJunior forward William Schlemmer said the team needs to remain grounded despite the big win\u00a0and understand that the Vikings will need to continue to improve in order to compete with some of their tougher opponents.\r\n\r\n\"We need to tower on half-court offense because the games we have difficulty in are those where the pace is slower and we can't get buckets in transition,\" Schlemmer said. \"This game shows that we need to be able to play with the intensity of [the Gunn game] every game even though we might not be as excited\u00a0because if we play as intensely as we do against Gunn,\u00a0we are hard to stop.\"\r\n\r\nThe Vikings outscored the Titans 21-2 in just under six minutes of play\u00a0and continued to add to their lead, heading into\u00a0the half with a sizable 38-18 advantage. Paly would go on to obliterate Gunn for the second and final time this year by a score of 79-36, beating the Titans\u00a0by 14 more points that the matchup earlier this season. Diepenbrock encourages the Paly community to bring the same roaring energy to the Vikings'\u00a0next big match-up on Saturday at Menlo-Atherton High School.\r\n\r\n\"Get it done. How much fun could that be?\" Depenbrock said. \"Going into an opposing gym and having the [expletive] place covered. Go to [Menlo-Atherton].\"\r\n\r\nUp next for the Vikings are league rematches against teams the boys already defeated handily. On Tuesday, the Vikings face the Los Altos High School Eagles (10-9, 2-5) at Los Altos and on Friday, Paly faces off against the Wilcox High School Chargers (9-9, 4-3).\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"The Vikings' dominated the Gunn High School Titans' basketball team (11-7, 2-5) on Friday, 79-36.

Athletic Director\u00a0Therren Willburn, 30 student-athletes have come together in hopes of improving involvement within the department.<\/span>\r\n\r\n\u201cThe purpose of the council\u00a0is to give Mrs. Bowers light into what the athletes want and we work to create experiences that are more fun for the fans and players,\u201d senior council member Peter Snodgrass said.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to providing insight into the daily life of a student-athlete, the council aims to encourage its peers to attend games through incentives such as raffles. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe have been planning events for boys' basketball,\" Snodgrass said. \"We were a little quiet first semester because we were gearing up and working up to events.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\nThe council is in the process of selling raffle tickets, according to Snodgrass.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So far we have made money selling old basketball jerseys, and with those funds we are going to raffle off a pair of Beats [headphones] at the next Paly vs. Gunn basketball game.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not only does the council want to continue to support Paly teams such as boys\u2019 and girls\u2019 basketball through three-point and half-court contests, but it\u00a0also aims to encourage attendance to sports that are often overlooked.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI think we\u2019ll soon grow to have more involvement in trying to reach sports that aren\u2019t usually recognized such as wrestling, swimming and badminton,\u201d Snodgrass said. \u201cWe want to try and make it so that more fans will want to go.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\nIn the future, the council aims to expand the athletics department. In an effort to integrate more of the student body, one of the council's goals is to provide roles to students who are not necessarily athletes.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cRight now we\u2019re hoping to get more student involvement within sports, not just athletics as in being a player on the team, but being an announcer, statistician or a team manager,\u201d Snodgrass said.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<strong>Wellness Committee: Integrating various wellness efforts<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The seven-person School Climate and Wellness Committee works with an intention to improve the well-being of students and staff at Paly by helping students de-stress.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe focus on mental health and communication between students and teachers, the state of the relationships between administrators and students, as well as students and parents,\u201d senior committee founder Cezanne Lane said.<\/span>\r\n\r\nThe committee also aims to help the various already existing wellness-related groups on campus work together.\u00a0The point of this committee is to bring all the student efforts together and to act as a liaison among them.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThere are different efforts going on in the realms of wellness,\" Lane said. \"There\u2019s Sources of Strength, as well as teacher, administration and board wellness efforts.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year, the committee will be hosting Change in Our Schools Week (previously known as Not in Our Schools Week), and it is\u00a0hopeful that involving several initiatives will strengthen the event. Working alongside science teacher Josh Bloom and Mental Health and Wellness Coordinator Jonathan Frecceri, co-leaders of Sources of Strength, the committee will work to dedicate one day to Sources.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Lane, the committee also works with Wellness Outreach Worker Julia Chang and Frecceri through the Wellness Center. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI\u2019ve been working really closely with them in planning and executing a lot of our events and ideas, so they\u2019re sort of our support system,\u201d Lane said.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recently the committee hosted a parent education night in the Media Arts Center that featured a panel of students discussing topics including interpersonal relationships, self care and post-high school plans.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cHopefully that [parent ed night] made the parent-student relationship better and we\u2019re relieving general pressure and stress,\u201d Lane said.<\/span>","excerpt":"Classic basketball jerseys, three-point contests, mindfulness and school climate; over the past year various committees have formed to improve the student experience at Paly.
