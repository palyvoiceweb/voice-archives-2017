Know)<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Club president junior\u00a0Keahi Asing says that \u201cR.O.C.K. stands for \"Reach Out. Care. Know,\" and is dedicated to mental health awareness and advocacy.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe want to build a strong community that supports itself, and ROCK focuses on educating kids like us on peer counseling so that we are all prepared if a friend, or anyone really, comes to us needing help,\u201d Asing said.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<strong>Paly Green Club<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to club co-president junior Sarah Shader, the club will focus on two aspects in regards to nature: preservation and appreciation.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cMy friend [and club co-president junior] Julie [Cornfield] and I realized that there wasn't an environmental club this year like there's been in past years, and so we decided we wanted to start our own,\u201d Shader said.<\/span>\r\n\r\nShader says the club will gather in and out of school.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u201cWe're going to do things like go on hikes and picnics, learn about how to cook food when you're camping, get wilderness first-aid certified, and [more].

Fifteen\u00a0Palo Alto High School senior athletes hit a milestone toward\u00a0that dream on Wednesday during lunch, when the school honored them\u00a0on National Signing Day in the Media Arts Center.\r\n\r\nThe National Signing Day Ceremony, usually the first Wednesday of February, marks the first day a high school senior athlete can sign the Letter of Intent for a sport with a school affiliated with the\u00a0<a title=\"National Collegiate Athletic Association\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association\">National Collegiate Athletic Association<\/a>.\r\n\r\nThe athletes include Alex Liang (Stanford University) and Grace Zhao (Stanford University) for swimming; Lauola Amanoni (San Jose State University), Mason Wittman (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill), Neil Verwillow (Trinity University) and Mara Zenger (Westminster College) for soccer; Troy Henderson (University of Puget Sound) and Peter Snodgrass (Northwestern University) for football; Jessica Lee (Claremont McKenna College) and Cassie Fong (San Francisco State University) for volleyball; Kimmi Chin (University of California, Los Angeles), Clay Watson (Columbia University) and Jackson Wood (University of Pennsylvania) for rowing; Kaitlin Chiu (Smith College) for lacrosse; and Bennet Huang (University of Iowa) for gymnastics.\r\n\r\nAccording to Liang, he feels extremely grateful for the opportunity to continue the sport he loves at a Division one school\u00a0for the next four years.\r\n\r\n\"I have sacrificed so much time and schoolwork over the years for this sport and it is finally paying off,\" Liang said. \"I am so excited and feel so fortunate to have the opportunity\u00a0to swim with such highly ranked swimmers at Stanford.\"\r\n\r\nPrincipal Kim Diorio, Athletic Director\u00a0Kathi Bowers and University of California-Davis alumna\u00a0and volleyball player Ally Whitson spoke at the event.\r\n\r\nBowers emphasized the importance\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">of recognizing that these student athletes have shown a consistent commitment both in the classroom and on the field, gym or pool throughout their years at Paly.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"This is a culmination of lots of work; it\u2019s not something that happens in one season or one year,\" Bowers said. \"It takes the support of their families, their coaches, their teachers and their friends.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\nWhitson shed\u00a0insight on the lessons she learned as a collegiate athlete to the college-bound seniors.\r\n\r\n\"<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s definitely going to be a few sacrifices that you are going to make, but you learn some of the most valuable lessons by playing a sport,\" Whitson said. \"First, you will learn time management: how to balance your practice schedule with academics and just being a college student. You will learn determination when you come in as a freshman: wanting to beat out a returning player to get that starting spot. You will also learn discipline: having to get out of bed when your alarm goes off in the middle of winter for 6\u00a0a.m. weights and biking\u00a0across Davis in the rain. Furthermore, one of the biggest things I learned was resilience: having to show up to practice the day after an extremely tough loss and ready to work even harder. Lastly, you will learn how to be a team player: you want to work as hard as you can for your teammates; after all, you will win together and lose together.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\nWhitson encouraged the athletes to enjoy the journey and to\u00a0not be afraid to reach out for help.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"Remember that you guys aren\u2019t alone in this adventure,\" Whitson said. \"Never hesitate to reach out to the people around you.

Illustration: Timothy Liu.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe 45th president of the United States had a very busy first week in which he issued several executive orders reflective of his major campaign promises. Below is a list of some of the most noteworthy actions taken\u00a0 by President Donald J. Trump during his first week in the Oval Office.\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/the-press-office\/2017\/01\/2\/executive-order-minimizing-economic-burden-patient-protection-and\">Affordable Care Act:<\/a><\/strong>\r\n\r\nThe president's first executive order was passed on the day of his inauguration, which is a relatively vague order aiming to \"minimize the economic burden\" of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\r\n\r\nIt begins with President Trump declaring that his administration will work to replace and repeal the act. The order itself is intended to reduce costs of the Affordable Care Act until this replacement occurs.\r\n\r\nWashington executives with authority under the act, such as\u00a0 have the power to \"waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision or requirement of the Act that would impose a fiscal burden on any State or a cost, fee, tax, penalty, or regulatory burden on individuals, families, healthcare providers, health insurers, patients, recipients of healthcare services, purchasers of health insurance, or makers of medical devices, products, or medications.\"\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/the-press-office\/2017\/01\/24\/executive-order-expediting-environmental-reviews-and-approvals-high\">Environmental Reviews and Infrastructure:<\/a><\/strong>\r\n\r\nTrump's next executive order was passed four days later, this time \"expediting environmental reviews and approvals for high priority infrastructure projects.\" Trump identifies the purpose of the order as an effort to increase the efficiency of decisions to promote infrastructure investment in order\u00a0to grow the American economy.\r\n\r\nThe president aims to expedite the process by implementing a 30-day period following a project's proposal, during which time the importance will be determined. If it is deemed to be highly beneficial to the \"general welfare\" of the nation, it will be labeled as a \"high priority.\"\r\n\r\nThe Chairman of the Council of Environmental Quality and the head of the relevant agency will then design \"expedited procedures and deadlines\" for the completion of environmental reviews and approvals of \"high priority\" projects.\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/the-press-office\/2017\/01\/25\/presidential-executive-order-enhancing-public-safety-interior-united\">Sanctuary Cities:<\/a><\/strong>\r\n\r\nOn Jan. 25, Trump issued another executive order that addresses sanctuary cities, which violate federal law by shielding undocumented immigrants from deportation.\r\n\r\nTrump introduces the order by stating \"The purpose of this order is to direct executive departments and agencies (agencies) to employ all lawful means to enforce the immigration laws of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nThe action will also \"ensure that jurisdictions that fail to comply with applicable Federal law do not receive Federal funds, except as mandated by law.\"\r\n\r\nTrump also emphasizes his desire for government agencies to utilize \"all available resources\" in ensuring that immigration laws and regulations are followed without exception.\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/the-press-office\/2017\/01\/25\/executive-order-border-security-and-immigration-enforcement-improvements\">Illegal Immigration\/The Wall:<\/a><\/strong>\r\n\r\nPresident Trump's next executive order, which was issued on Jan. 25, was intended to reduce the strain on both federal resources and federal organizations responsible for maintaining border security. Trump specifically names illegal immigration across the southern border as the cause of this strain. In line with one of President Trump's most notable campaign promises, this executive order begins the process of constructing a wall on America's border with Mexico.\r\n\r\nThe action's most notable component is the process to \"secure the southern border of the United States through the immediate construction of a physical wall on the southern border, monitored and supported by adequate personnel so as to prevent illegal immigration, drug and human trafficking, and acts of terrorism.\"\r\n\r\nThe order also pushes government agencies to speed up the process of determining the eligibility of a person detained on suspicion of violating US immigration policy.\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/the-press-office\/2017\/01\/27\/executive-order-protecting-nation-foreign-terrorist-entry-united-states\">Restriction on Immigration\/Travel:<\/a><\/strong>\r\n\r\nOn Jan. 27, Trump passed an executive order which implements a \"Suspension of Issuance of Visas and Other Immigration Benefits to Nationals of Countries of Particular Concern.\" These countries include Iraq, Iran, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Somalia and Libya.\r\n\r\nTrump also ordered that for a 90 day period, \"immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of aliens\" from these 7 countries will be restricted. Foreign nationals traveling on certain diplomatic visas will be exempt from this restriction.\r\n\r\nTravelers who are detained are subject to vetting and investigation. Once they have been evaluated, the travelers will be either be permitted access to the country or denied it, depending on whether or not they can be confirmed as peaceful.\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/the-press-office\/2017\/01\/28\/executive-order-ethics-commitments-executive-branch-appointees\">Ethics Pledge:<\/a><\/strong>\r\n\r\nThe president issued yet another executive order on Jan. 28, consisting of nine major ethical commitments which the members of his executive branch must uphold. These commitments range from preventing members of his cabinet from participating in certain lobbying activities, to keeping members of his cabinet from being influenced by lobbyists during their service.\r\n\r\nThe order also mandates that the members of his cabinet carefully read and then sign the document.\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/the-press-office\/2017\/01\/27\/executive-order-protecting-nation-foreign-terrorist-entry-united-states\">Government Regulation of Business:<\/a><\/strong>\r\n\r\nOn Jan. 28, the president passed an executive order impacting federal regulation of business. This executive order requires a minimum of two previously existing governmental regulations of business to be proposed for elimination whenever a new policy is implemented. It is in line with his \"one in two out\" campaign promise.\r\n\r\nTrump declared that that it \"is important that for every one new regulation issued, at least two prior regulations be identified for elimination, and that the cost of planned regulations be prudently managed and controlled through a budgeting process.\"\r\n\r\nThis executive order specifically affects the \"fiscal year 2017, which is in progress\". This statement restricts the longevity of the order to the end of this fiscal year.\r\n\r\nThe order also mandates that \"the total incremental cost\" of\u00a0 all new regulations, including repealed regulations, finalized in 2017 cannot exceed zero, unless otherwise required by law or if advised by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (Director).\r\n\r\nTrump has had a very busy first week, and this will not be the end of his actions as president. Check back with The Paly Voice for future breakdowns of the Trump administration's actions.","excerpt":"The 45th president of the United States had a very busy first week in which he issued several executive orders reflective of his major campaign promises.

The Vikings would go on to shut out the Spartans, ending Mountain View's winning streak and prolonging their own. Photo: Jackson Doerr[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThough it is a common conception that Palo Alto High School's primary athletic rival is either Gunn or Los Gatos, if you ask a member of the girls' soccer team, the response will overwhelmingly be \u201cMountain View.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was the Spartans who stopped the Vikings from winning the Central Coast Section final in 2015. It was Mountain View that ended the Vikings' chance at a perfect season in 2016. Other teams may see Mountain View as a tough opponent, but nothing more than that: they have no vendetta with the Spartans the way the girls\u2019 soccer team does.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s fitting, then, that Paly would face off against Mountain View in almost the exact same position that they were in a year ago, with the Vikes\u2019 undefeated record on the line. But this time, instead of faltering for the third time, the Vikings prevailed, emerging with a 2-0 victory, propelling them into first place in the De Anza League, with an almost spotless record of 5-0-3, edging out Mountain View\u2019s record of 5-1-1.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The highlight of the game occurred late in the first half, with the ball being fiercely contested by both teams, neither side maintaining possession for longer than a minute. Senior defender Lauola Amanoni spotted an opening, sprinting up from the back line, she received a pass from freshman midfielder Chloe Japic. Dribbling the ball up the middle, Amanoni beat out two consecutive Spartan defenders and fired a shot from way beyond the 18-yard line into the goal. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amanoni\u2019s goal woke the Vikings up; their play became more precise, and not five minutes later they had scored again, this time a goal by Japic.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the Vikes may have shut the Spartans out, play was not perfect on the defensive side. Communication errors plagued Paly early in the game, leading to some goal opportunities for Mountain View.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senior midfielder Tess Preising attributes the on-field confusion to a new formation the Vikings were trying out.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWhat we didn\u2019t do too well was defending and marking because we played with a new formation,\u201d Preising said. \u201cWe were doing a 5-4-1 so some of us were confused in the midfield.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The new formation certainly caused some disarray on the field, but as the game progressed, errors appeared less and less. Chatter on the field increased, players letting each other know if they had time, or if they had to get rid of the ball immediately. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mountain View\u2019s errors came from their inability to capitalize on mistakes that Paly made. Too often the Vikes would fail to get the ball out of their back line, or if they did, it would immediately return to a Spartan player. Amanoni recognizes the team's difficulties with clearing the ball as a problem to work on. \u201cWe kept clearing it [the ball], where they were able to advance off of it.\u201d\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to head coach Kurt Devlin, Paly faced off against Mountain View down several players.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe need to work on getting healthy,\" Devlin said. \"We have a bunch of girls that are nicked up or sick, so we need to rest and get healthy for the rest of the way out.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team\u2019s next match will be against the Homestead High School Mustangs, who currently sit in the middle of the De Anza league standings with a record of 4-4-0. The game at Homestead on Thursday will give the Vikings the chance to try out their new formation again before facing third place Santa Clara High School (3-0-3) in a week.<\/span>","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School girls' soccer team emerged victorious over Mountain View with a final score of 2-0.

The march sought predominantly to advocate for women's rights, but also to stand in solidarity with the diverse communities in our country, and for the freedom of expression and choice of individuals of all races, religions, ethnicities and sexual orientations, according to the Women's\u00a0March on Washington <a href=\"https:\/\/www.womensmarch.com\/mission\/\">website<\/a>.\r\n\r\nThe crowd of 2.5 million people across the world sent a strong signal, organizers said, to the world and our government that the coming years will be unfamiliar territory, the future a time of action and bold change.\r\n\r\nThe Paly Voice marched alongside the powerful crowd and gathered personal stories of those who felt it necessary to speak up that day.\r\n\r\n<strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; color: #ff99cc;\">Scenes from the San Fransisco Women's March<\/span><\/strong>\r\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/tpFMypWPvZA\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; color: #ff99cc;\"><strong>Locations of sister marches throughout California<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\r\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/d\/embed?mid=16Ryr-xl3ghrwTItdGlV_megnmqA\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\"><\/iframe>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-size: 18pt; color: #ff99cc;\"><strong>The Train\u00a0<\/strong><\/span>\r\n\r\nAt the Caltrain station on the way to the protest, Palo Altans formed a crowd sporting pink \"pussy hats,\" a reference to a leaked video of\u00a0President Trump remark's towards women\u00a0and holding bright colored signs. The line for the ticket booth, including this group of reporters for The Paly Voice, stretched to the other side of the station and the ticket dispensers ran out of exact change for the demonstrators. An excited energy of anticipation prickled the air as people stood waiting for the 2:30 p.m. train.\r\n\r\nStanford student Yaelle Viner was one demonstrator wearing a pink hat. She smiled through the cold air as she explained why she found it necessary to partake in the march.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have a 6-year-old sister, and granted she is a little young to understand socio-political issues, but I am marching so [that] she is able to see a world as progressive as I have seen in my lifetime,\u201d Viner said.\r\n\r\nHer friend, Grace Wallace, stressed the importance of advocating for intersectional feminism, emphasizing that we must remember how limited an individualist viewpoint can be.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_128533\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"370\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/trainstation.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-128533\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/trainstation.jpg\" alt=\"trainstation\" width=\"370\" height=\"247\" \/><\/a> Palo Alto student protesters Grace Wallace, Emma Rothenburg, Yaelle Viner and Sarah Vernalis hold a poster reading, \"I march for intersectional feminism.\" Photo: Rachel Code.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n\u201cI am marching to show that feminist causes are intersectional and apply to many different people,\" Wallace said. \u00a0\"All of them are equally valid and need to be heard. My sign reads, \u2018I march for intersectional feminism\u2019 and then on the back, \u2018not open-minded fascism.' Intersectionality is basically the theory that identities coalesce to form different experiences\u00a0so that the experience of a white-identifying woman and a black-identifying woman will not be the same and it is important to acknowledge those differences.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs the train arrived, the demonstrators filled the train-cars past their limit, no seat remained empty, no isle devoid of pink. People clung to the windows and each other, cramped on stairs and in walkways as they made their way into the city.\r\n\r\nBella Gaberal, a Gunn High School senior riding the Caltrain, reflected on the excitement of taking part in a global movement.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt\u2019s [The protest is] happening worldwide and in many countries,\u201d Gaberal\u00a0said. \u201cTo me it\u2019s just a promise to keep fighting.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\nAs the journey continued and the train reached the San Francisco station, the lines, between young and old, between the Palo-Altan and the San Francisco natives, between race, gender, ethnicity mingled into a\u00a0single entity as the crowd bonded in a common purpose.\r\n\r\nEmma Rothenburg, protester and college\u00a0student, grew up surrounded by\u00a0a powerful female environment. For her, it was important that her mom, her sister and all women and men alike were marching, although separated by miles, together.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am marching with my mother and sister \u2014 my mother is down in southern California and my sister will be in S.F. so I am joining them,\u201d Rothenburg said. \u201cI was raised by a strong female, who was also raised by another strong female and so on.\u00a0I know there is nothing a woman can't do and I want everyone to know that.\u201d\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_128548\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/littleboy1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-128548\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/littleboy1.jpg\" alt=\"littleboy\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" \/><\/a> A small boy sits on the shoulders of his father amidst the wild crowds of the San Francisco Women's March at the Civic Center Plaza on Jan. 21.

Instead, they embraced the cold dreary weather in a sort of protest, taking out pink rain jackets and vibrant umbrella\u2019s and craning their necks to listen to Supervisor Jane Kim as she passionately spoke into the microphone insisting that San Francisco has an important role in gender equality and women\u2019s rights. This was followed by speakers making statements about the election and \"moving forward.\"\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the night moved on, folk singer Joan Baez and queer hip hop artist <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MicahTron<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">performed, energizing the crowd and moving most to their feet regardless of age.

Originally from Brazil and working in a psychology department centered on children's rights issues, Santos explained in a heavy accent how we must view this march with a broad perspective, going farther than the streets of S.F. and even Washington.<\/span>\r\n\r\n\u201cI decided to come to the march because it is an international movement,\" dos Santos said. \"There is a conservative movement taking over the country \u2014 in Brazil it is also happening.

Thousands of people poured into dark San Francisco streets lit up by red lanterns, the light reflecting off puddles and raindrops still clinging to umbrellas and jackets, that in turn illuminated the streets with a warm flickering glow. Loud chants echoed through the city, voices joining through the soft pattering of rain as the storm subsided.\r\n\r\nAccording to dos Santos, while walking in the rain a special energy took over the crowd.\r\n\r\n\u201cWalking, I felt the sensation of coming together, of thousands of people coming together,\" dos Santos said. \"I like the energy, the energy that comes out of these gatherings. I feel like oh my God, these people, we are talking about the same language. The energy is part of it, it helps us see how people can make a difference.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn Brazil,\u201d dos Santos added, \u201cit would probably be louder, with dancing. Here it was very orderly and quiet, but I like the phrases that were said.

For Chute, the best way to do this was by joining a peaceful Women's March, which was held the day after President Trump's inauguration in Washington D.C.\r\n\r\n\"Once I found out about it [the march], I started messaging people about it,\" Chute said.\u00a0\"I needed to do something, and this was the quickest thing I could throw myself into.\"\r\n\r\nDetermined to\u00a0join the demonstration in Washington, she\u00a0began to coordinate a trip with her peers from Paly. Special Education Instructional Supervisor Laura Bricca quickly expressed interest in accompanying Chute. Together, the two of them set off for D.C.\r\n\r\n\"We didn't get there until one in the morning before the march,\" Chute said.\u00a0\"We were way outside the city, and\u00a0everybody was converging on Washington.\"\r\n\r\nThe streets were\u00a0filled with marchers who were all headed towards the demonstration.\u00a0While moving through the dense crowd, Chute first noticed the obvious diversity of the demonstrators.\r\n\r\n\"It felt like every nationality, every age group, every gender was represented,\" Chute said. \"It was such a powerful, uplifting feeling to think that everyone was in this together.\"\r\n\r\nShe was quickly inspired and moved by the sight of so many different people who were connected by their pride and love for their nation and democracy.\r\n\r\n\"What felt powerful to me was wondering\u00a0'have we finally reached a place where all these people understand that oppression against anyone is oppression against everyone?'\" Chute said. \"The humanity of it all was overwhelming.\"\r\n\r\nChute met a wide array of people, with whom she exchanged messages of acceptance, love\u00a0and understanding.\r\n\r\n\"I don't have to understand these people's life choices, but I do support the right for all people to have a happy life and make those choices,\" Chute said.\r\n\r\nThe group decided to turn some of the president's comments into a symbolic source of unity.\r\n\r\n\"When Trump was commenting on the Inauguration attendance, he said something about the tarps that were covering all of the plants and blaming them for why it looked like there weren't many people [in attendance],\" Chute said. \"Those very same tarps were confiscated by marchers.\"\r\n\r\nThe demonstrators connected the tarps together\u00a0and wrote the preamble to the constitution across the top. The rest of the tarps stretched for blocks\u00a0and were covered in the signatures of all who attended the march.\r\n\r\n\"For an\u00a0hour of the march hundreds of thousands of people were carrying this tarp, and having people watching on the sides sign it,\" Chute said.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_128510\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"372\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/We-The-People-Tarp.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-128510\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/We-The-People-Tarp.jpg\" alt=\"Caption Caption Caption\" width=\"372\" height=\"279\" \/><\/a> Participants in the march carried tarps covered in the words of the constitution for miles during the march, and they invited\u00a0spectators to sign it.

However, they weren\u2019t alone; backing them up were hundreds of protesters from around the Bay Area. Among the crowd were several students,\u00a0who told The Paly Voice that\u00a0they had no plan to leave until those five people walked out of the terminal with them.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the attending Paly students, junior Lia Straight, said she felt compelled to join the protest because she wanted to aid\u00a0detainees as well as stand up against the current state of US politics.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n\u201cI decided to go to the protest today because if I didn't go, if I didn't stand up and fight everyone's rights, who else would?\u201d Straight said. \u201cI'm not a lawyer. I'm not anyone in a position of power, but I can go to this protest and I can help shut down SFO and put pressure on Trump and our government to stop violating people's rights and the Constitution.\u201d\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the other attending students, sophomore\u00a0Harrison Frahn, recounted\u00a0learning about the implications of Trump's ban from his fellow protesters.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI talked to several people who were immigrants or refugees, and were allowed to come to the U.S. legally,\u201d Frahn said. \u201cOne of them told me that it took him seven whole years to get his green card after he came to the U.S., and he that it took others even longer.

Restaurants sent us food, people told stories of how Trump's executive order affected them, moms brought their toddlers and set up stations to make signs [and] people supported one another. SFO is a very large airport, but it felt incredibly small with the [tens] of hundreds of protestors screaming and chanting and taking up space, persisting in this fight for people's rights.\u201d\r\n\r\nFrahn echoed Straight's sentiments.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt was very uplifting to see that there are so many people united against hate and discrimination and that so many people are willing to fight for the rights of others,\" Frahn said. \"We were all there to show the Trump administration that the American people will stand up for the rights of all people, to show that not all Americans support the kind of discriminatory policies that the Trump administration is putting in place and that we will fight to make sure that nobody is treated unfairly or discriminated against based on their beliefs.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After a weekend of full of marching, chanting and pure determination, protesters received word that the five detainees had been released at around 7 p.m. Sunday evening.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt felt like we were all making history,\u201d Straight said. \u201cWe surrounded the entire international terminal of SFO with a thick band of protestors, marching and chanting.
