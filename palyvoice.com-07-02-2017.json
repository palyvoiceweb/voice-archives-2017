Nothing seemed to go right for the Vikings; shots didn't fall, rebounds just out of reach, and calls didn't go their way.\r\n\r\nPalo Alto suffered its first defeat in over a month, falling to the Menlo-Atherton Bears (17-4, 8-1), 58-46.\r\n\r\nThe loss was especially surprising, after another resounding league victory against\u00a0the Wilcox Chargers (9-10, 4-4) on Friday night, 73-52, clinching first place\u00a0in league play in the De Anza League.\r\n\r\nJunior guard Jared Wulbrun thinks that the title can be a stepping stone to success for Paly.\r\n\r\n\"As a team, we set goals for the season and this was our first one,\" Wulbrun said. \"You have to take the season one step at a time and we reached that on Friday night. We can't be satisfied, though. We all know what our other goals are that we want to achieve, so this is just the beginning. There's a lot of work left to do.\"\r\n\r\nThe game started off well for the Vikings, who led by eight points at the end of the first quarter\u00a0and extended their lead to 12 points just into the second quarter.\r\n\r\nThen, everything began to fall apart for the Vikings. Menlo-Atherton senior guard Eric Norton,\u00a0who scored a game-high 22 points, led the charge for the Bears and netted seven points in the second quarter. The Bears dominated the latter parts of the second period and the teams headed into halftime knotted at 28-28.\r\n\r\nThe second half started no better than the first half ended. Menlo-Atherton took an early lead and never relented, ultimately outlasting the Vikings.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_129227\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/IMG_1344.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-129227\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/IMG_1344.jpg\" alt=\"Junior Bryant Jefferson lines up a free throw against Menlo-Atherton.

I\u2019m going to be so sad to see the seniors go, we\u2019re all going to cry.\"\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, Madhav and senior club vice president Alicia Mies received Honorable Mentions as Bolivia on the LEGAL\u00a0committee. \u00a0The legal committee deals with issues of international law and legal infrastructure. Mies, along with former Paly student Laure Blanchez, who now attends\u00a0Li Po Chun United World College in Hong Kong, won the first major award for the club in 2016 as Outstanding Delegates, one of the three tiers of awards that can be won.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Seniors Kimberly Markevitch and MUN secretary Aidan Maese-Czeropski both won Honorable Mentions for Bolivia on the SOCHUM (Social-Humanitarian) committee in the conference. The committee\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">deals with social, humanitarian and cultural issues such as\u00a0reproductive rights, racism, refugees and child rights.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maese-Czeropski previously received a Verbal Commendation in November 2016 at the Stanford Model United Nations Conference. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Madhav is excited about what lies in store for the\u00a0club.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI know that this conference marks a new mark of achievement in Model UN's continued growth and achievement as a club,\u201d Madhav said. <\/span>","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School Model United Nations club is celebrating an exceptional performance this weekend at the Santa Clara Valley Model United Nations Conference, where they received six awards.\r\n\r\n\r\n","date":"2017-02-02 17:51:53","author":"Soumya Jhaveri","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/16466304_10206273999487767_422112059_o1.jpg","categories":["Global Outlook","News"],"tags":["aidan maese-czeropski","alicia mies","asia gardias","kimberly markevitch","mun","paly mun","ryan wisowaty","scvmun","Tara Madhav"]},{"id":128733,"title":"15 senior athletes commit to schools on National Signing Day","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2017\/02\/02\/15-senior-athletes-commit-to-schools-on-national-signing-day\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_129049\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"563\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/IMG_7124.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-129049\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/IMG_7124.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_7124\" width=\"563\" height=\"337\" \/><\/a> Palo Alto High School student athletes convened during lunch on Wednesday in the Media Arts Center for the\u00a0National Signing Day Ceremony. \"You have made our entire school community proud and we are so happy to celebrate this with you,\" Principal Kim Diorio said. \"You embody all the values that we hold so dearly at Paly: things like integrity, respect, teamwork and collaboration.\" Photo: Daniel Li.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nMany student athletes often dream of the day when they can represent their school at the collegiate level. Fifteen\u00a0Palo Alto High School senior athletes hit a milestone toward\u00a0that dream on Wednesday during lunch, when the school honored them\u00a0on National Signing Day in the Media Arts Center.\r\n\r\nThe National Signing Day Ceremony, usually the first Wednesday of February, marks the first day a high school senior athlete can sign the Letter of Intent for a sport with a school affiliated with the\u00a0<a title=\"National Collegiate Athletic Association\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association\">National Collegiate Athletic Association<\/a>.\r\n\r\nThe athletes include Alex Liang (Stanford University) and Grace Zhao (Stanford University) for swimming; Lauola Amanoni (San Jose State University), Mason Wittman (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill), Neil Verwillow (Trinity University) and Mara Zenger (Westminster College) for soccer; Troy Henderson (University of Puget Sound) and Peter Snodgrass (Northwestern University) for football; Jessica Lee (Claremont McKenna College) and Cassie Fong (San Francisco State University) for volleyball; Kimmi Chin (University of California, Los Angeles), Clay Watson (Columbia University) and Jackson Wood (University of Pennsylvania) for rowing; Kaitlin Chiu (Smith College) for lacrosse; and Bennet Huang (University of Iowa) for gymnastics.\r\n\r\nAccording to Liang, he feels extremely grateful for the opportunity to continue the sport he loves at a Division one school\u00a0for the next four years.\r\n\r\n\"I have sacrificed so much time and schoolwork over the years for this sport and it is finally paying off,\" Liang said. \"I am so excited and feel so fortunate to have the opportunity\u00a0to swim with such highly ranked swimmers at Stanford.\"\r\n\r\nPrincipal Kim Diorio, Athletic Director\u00a0Kathi Bowers and University of California-Davis alumna\u00a0and volleyball player Ally Whitson spoke at the event.\r\n\r\nBowers emphasized the importance\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">of recognizing that these student athletes have shown a consistent commitment both in the classroom and on the field, gym or pool throughout their years at Paly.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"This is a culmination of lots of work; it\u2019s not something that happens in one season or one year,\" Bowers said. \"It takes the support of their families, their coaches, their teachers and their friends.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\nWhitson shed\u00a0insight on the lessons she learned as a collegiate athlete to the college-bound seniors.\r\n\r\n\"<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s definitely going to be a few sacrifices that you are going to make, but you learn some of the most valuable lessons by playing a sport,\" Whitson said. \"First, you will learn time management: how to balance your practice schedule with academics and just being a college student. You will learn determination when you come in as a freshman: wanting to beat out a returning player to get that starting spot. You will also learn discipline: having to get out of bed when your alarm goes off in the middle of winter for 6\u00a0a.m. weights and biking\u00a0across Davis in the rain. Furthermore, one of the biggest things I learned was resilience: having to show up to practice the day after an extremely tough loss and ready to work even harder. Lastly, you will learn how to be a team player: you want to work as hard as you can for your teammates; after all, you will win together and lose together.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\nWhitson encouraged the athletes to enjoy the journey and to\u00a0not be afraid to reach out for help.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"Remember that you guys aren\u2019t alone in this adventure,\" Whitson said. \"Never hesitate to reach out to the people around you.

Illustration: Timothy Liu.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe 45th president of the United States had a very busy first week in which he issued several executive orders reflective of his major campaign promises. Below is a list of some of the most noteworthy actions taken\u00a0 by President Donald J. Trump during his first week in the Oval Office.\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/the-press-office\/2017\/01\/2\/executive-order-minimizing-economic-burden-patient-protection-and\">Affordable Care Act:<\/a><\/strong>\r\n\r\nThe president's first executive order was passed on the day of his inauguration, which is a relatively vague order aiming to \"minimize the economic burden\" of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\r\n\r\nIt begins with President Trump declaring that his administration will work to replace and repeal the act. The order itself is intended to reduce costs of the Affordable Care Act until this replacement occurs.\r\n\r\nWashington executives with authority under the act, such as\u00a0 have the power to \"waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision or requirement of the Act that would impose a fiscal burden on any State or a cost, fee, tax, penalty, or regulatory burden on individuals, families, healthcare providers, health insurers, patients, recipients of healthcare services, purchasers of health insurance, or makers of medical devices, products, or medications.\"\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/the-press-office\/2017\/01\/24\/executive-order-expediting-environmental-reviews-and-approvals-high\">Environmental Reviews and Infrastructure:<\/a><\/strong>\r\n\r\nTrump's next executive order was passed four days later, this time \"expediting environmental reviews and approvals for high priority infrastructure projects.\" Trump identifies the purpose of the order as an effort to increase the efficiency of decisions to promote infrastructure investment in order\u00a0to grow the American economy.\r\n\r\nThe president aims to expedite the process by implementing a 30-day period following a project's proposal, during which time the importance will be determined. If it is deemed to be highly beneficial to the \"general welfare\" of the nation, it will be labeled as a \"high priority.\"\r\n\r\nThe Chairman of the Council of Environmental Quality and the head of the relevant agency will then design \"expedited procedures and deadlines\" for the completion of environmental reviews and approvals of \"high priority\" projects.\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/the-press-office\/2017\/01\/25\/presidential-executive-order-enhancing-public-safety-interior-united\">Sanctuary Cities:<\/a><\/strong>\r\n\r\nOn Jan. 25, Trump issued another executive order that addresses sanctuary cities, which violate federal law by shielding undocumented immigrants from deportation.\r\n\r\nTrump introduces the order by stating \"The purpose of this order is to direct executive departments and agencies (agencies) to employ all lawful means to enforce the immigration laws of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nThe action will also \"ensure that jurisdictions that fail to comply with applicable Federal law do not receive Federal funds, except as mandated by law.\"\r\n\r\nTrump also emphasizes his desire for government agencies to utilize \"all available resources\" in ensuring that immigration laws and regulations are followed without exception.\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/the-press-office\/2017\/01\/25\/executive-order-border-security-and-immigration-enforcement-improvements\">Illegal Immigration\/The Wall:<\/a><\/strong>\r\n\r\nPresident Trump's next executive order, which was issued on Jan. 25, was intended to reduce the strain on both federal resources and federal organizations responsible for maintaining border security. Trump specifically names illegal immigration across the southern border as the cause of this strain. In line with one of President Trump's most notable campaign promises, this executive order begins the process of constructing a wall on America's border with Mexico.\r\n\r\nThe action's most notable component is the process to \"secure the southern border of the United States through the immediate construction of a physical wall on the southern border, monitored and supported by adequate personnel so as to prevent illegal immigration, drug and human trafficking, and acts of terrorism.\"\r\n\r\nThe order also pushes government agencies to speed up the process of determining the eligibility of a person detained on suspicion of violating US immigration policy.\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/the-press-office\/2017\/01\/27\/executive-order-protecting-nation-foreign-terrorist-entry-united-states\">Restriction on Immigration\/Travel:<\/a><\/strong>\r\n\r\nOn Jan. 27, Trump passed an executive order which implements a \"Suspension of Issuance of Visas and Other Immigration Benefits to Nationals of Countries of Particular Concern.\" These countries include Iraq, Iran, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Somalia and Libya.\r\n\r\nTrump also ordered that for a 90 day period, \"immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of aliens\" from these 7 countries will be restricted. Foreign nationals traveling on certain diplomatic visas will be exempt from this restriction.\r\n\r\nTravelers who are detained are subject to vetting and investigation. Once they have been evaluated, the travelers will be either be permitted access to the country or denied it, depending on whether or not they can be confirmed as peaceful.\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/the-press-office\/2017\/01\/28\/executive-order-ethics-commitments-executive-branch-appointees\">Ethics Pledge:<\/a><\/strong>\r\n\r\nThe president issued yet another executive order on Jan. 28, consisting of nine major ethical commitments which the members of his executive branch must uphold. These commitments range from preventing members of his cabinet from participating in certain lobbying activities, to keeping members of his cabinet from being influenced by lobbyists during their service.\r\n\r\nThe order also mandates that the members of his cabinet carefully read and then sign the document.\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/the-press-office\/2017\/01\/27\/executive-order-protecting-nation-foreign-terrorist-entry-united-states\">Government Regulation of Business:<\/a><\/strong>\r\n\r\nOn Jan. 28, the president passed an executive order impacting federal regulation of business. This executive order requires a minimum of two previously existing governmental regulations of business to be proposed for elimination whenever a new policy is implemented. It is in line with his \"one in two out\" campaign promise.\r\n\r\nTrump declared that that it \"is important that for every one new regulation issued, at least two prior regulations be identified for elimination, and that the cost of planned regulations be prudently managed and controlled through a budgeting process.\"\r\n\r\nThis executive order specifically affects the \"fiscal year 2017, which is in progress\". This statement restricts the longevity of the order to the end of this fiscal year.\r\n\r\nThe order also mandates that \"the total incremental cost\" of\u00a0 all new regulations, including repealed regulations, finalized in 2017 cannot exceed zero, unless otherwise required by law or if advised by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (Director).\r\n\r\nTrump has had a very busy first week, and this will not be the end of his actions as president.

The Vikings would go on to shut out the Spartans, ending Mountain View's winning streak and prolonging their own. Photo: Jackson Doerr[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThough it is a common conception that Palo Alto High School's primary athletic rival is either Gunn or Los Gatos, if you ask a member of the girls' soccer team, the response will overwhelmingly be \u201cMountain View.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was the Spartans who stopped the Vikings from winning the Central Coast Section final in 2015. It was Mountain View that ended the Vikings' chance at a perfect season in 2016. Other teams may see Mountain View as a tough opponent, but nothing more than that: they have no vendetta with the Spartans the way the girls\u2019 soccer team does.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s fitting, then, that Paly would face off against Mountain View in almost the exact same position that they were in a year ago, with the Vikes\u2019 undefeated record on the line. But this time, instead of faltering for the third time, the Vikings prevailed, emerging with a 2-0 victory, propelling them into first place in the De Anza League, with an almost spotless record of 5-0-3, edging out Mountain View\u2019s record of 5-1-1.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The highlight of the game occurred late in the first half, with the ball being fiercely contested by both teams, neither side maintaining possession for longer than a minute. Senior defender Lauola Amanoni spotted an opening, sprinting up from the back line, she received a pass from freshman midfielder Chloe Japic. Dribbling the ball up the middle, Amanoni beat out two consecutive Spartan defenders and fired a shot from way beyond the 18-yard line into the goal. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amanoni\u2019s goal woke the Vikings up; their play became more precise, and not five minutes later they had scored again, this time a goal by Japic.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the Vikes may have shut the Spartans out, play was not perfect on the defensive side. Communication errors plagued Paly early in the game, leading to some goal opportunities for Mountain View.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senior midfielder Tess Preising attributes the on-field confusion to a new formation the Vikings were trying out.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWhat we didn\u2019t do too well was defending and marking because we played with a new formation,\u201d Preising said. \u201cWe were doing a 5-4-1 so some of us were confused in the midfield.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The new formation certainly caused some disarray on the field, but as the game progressed, errors appeared less and less. Chatter on the field increased, players letting each other know if they had time, or if they had to get rid of the ball immediately. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mountain View\u2019s errors came from their inability to capitalize on mistakes that Paly made. Too often the Vikes would fail to get the ball out of their back line, or if they did, it would immediately return to a Spartan player. Amanoni recognizes the team's difficulties with clearing the ball as a problem to work on. \u201cWe kept clearing it [the ball], where they were able to advance off of it.\u201d\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to head coach Kurt Devlin, Paly faced off against Mountain View down several players.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe need to work on getting healthy,\" Devlin said. \"We have a bunch of girls that are nicked up or sick, so we need to rest and get healthy for the rest of the way out.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team\u2019s next match will be against the Homestead High School Mustangs, who currently sit in the middle of the De Anza league standings with a record of 4-4-0. The game at Homestead on Thursday will give the Vikings the chance to try out their new formation again before facing third place Santa Clara High School (3-0-3) in a week.<\/span>","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School girls' soccer team emerged victorious over Mountain View with a final score of 2-0.
