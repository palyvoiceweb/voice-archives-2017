Rojahn's job? Shoot three-pointers\u2014 lots of them. Playing in his second consecutive season on the Palo Alto High School boys' basketball team (16-2, 7-0), Rojahn and\u00a0fellow three-point juggernaut junior guard\u00a0Jared Wulbrun, have become the \"splash brothers\" of the Paly team. Rojahn provided the spark to the Vikings' domination of the Gunn High School Titans' basketball team (11-7, 2-5) on Friday, 79-36, hitting a couple three-pointers in the opening minutes, electrifying the crowd and setting the tone for the rest of the night.\u00a0With half of the regular season in the books, the Vikings remain the top dogs in the De Anza League.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_128729\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"475\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/spencer-celebrating.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-128729\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/spencer-celebrating.jpg\" alt=\"Junior guard Spencer Rojahn gets pumped up by fellow junior guard Brey Johnson pregame.

Rojahn hit two early three-pointers on Friday against Gunn High School. Photo: Rachel Code[\/caption]\r\n\r\nOver the course of play, Paly's swarming defense proved to be too much to handle for the Titans. Midway through the second quarter, Paly scored on three consecutive stolen passes and did not\u00a0allow the Gunn offense to pass the half-court line during those three possessions. A combination of the\u00a0Viking starting lineups' average height of just under six foot three inches and\u00a0a strong press defense enabled Paly to play at its desired game tempo and forced countless Titan turnovers.\r\n\r\nTo accompany the exceptional play of the starting lineup, \u00a0junior point guard Will Schmutz subbed in for senior starting point guard and team captain Miles Tention in the second half and excited the crowd with 11 points of his own. \"MVP\" chants erupted from the Paly sections following each of Schmutz's baskets. Also off the bench, junior guard Brey Johnson, junior center Bryant Jefferson, senior point guard Ethan Stern and senior guard Jack Simison added to the insurmountable Viking lead with a combined 25 points off the bench. Johnson added the exclamation point on the blowout win with a huge block on a Gunn guard during the closing minutes of the game.\r\n\r\nThe Titans struggled to find their groove on offense, ending the game without a double-digit scorer. Gunn senior forward Jeffery Lee-Heidenreich led the Titans with nine points, and senior guard Josh Radin poured in six of his own.\r\n\r\nPaly head coach Peter Diepenbrock said the Vikings' continued dominance has played a large factor in the team's mindset moving forward.\r\n\r\n\"We've won eight games\u00a0in a row and we keep improving so it's huge,\" Diepenbrock said. \"This win reconfirms what we're trying to do and it shows that we're going in the right direction.\"\r\n\r\nDespite the lengthy winning streak, Diepenbrock has seen this story before and said the team needs to remain grounded after its successes. Last season, the Vikings headed into the Central Coast Section playoffs having won the majority of the match-ups leading up the first round of CCS\u00a0but\u00a0were defeated in the first round.\r\n\r\n\"That's the challenge,\" Diepenbrock said. \"We have to be a much more mature team. Last year we couldn't handle this so hopefully we will keep practicing hard and keep our focus because we have bigger goals than just to win the league.\"\r\n\r\nJunior forward William Schlemmer said the team needs to remain grounded despite the big win\u00a0and understand that the Vikings will need to continue to improve in order to compete with some of their tougher opponents.\r\n\r\n\"We need to tower on half-court offense because the games we have difficulty in are those where the pace is slower and we can't get buckets in transition,\" Schlemmer said. \"This game shows that we need to be able to play with the intensity of [the Gunn game] every game even though we might not be as excited\u00a0because if we play as intensely as we do against Gunn,\u00a0we are hard to stop.\"\r\n\r\nThe Vikings outscored the Titans 21-2 in just under six minutes of play\u00a0and continued to add to their lead, heading into\u00a0the half with a sizable 38-18 advantage. Paly would go on to obliterate Gunn for the second and final time this year by a score of 79-36, beating the Titans\u00a0by 14 more points that the matchup earlier this season. Diepenbrock encourages the Paly community to bring the same roaring energy to the Vikings'\u00a0next big match-up on Saturday at Menlo-Atherton High School.\r\n\r\n\"Get it done. How much fun could that be?\" Depenbrock said. \"Going into an opposing gym and having the [expletive] place covered. Go to [Menlo-Atherton].\"\r\n\r\nUp next for the Vikings are league rematches against teams the boys already defeated handily. On Tuesday, the Vikings face the Los Altos High School Eagles (10-9, 2-5) at Los Altos and on Friday, Paly faces off against the Wilcox High School Chargers (9-9, 4-3).\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"The Vikings' dominated the Gunn High School Titans' basketball team (11-7, 2-5) on Friday, 79-36.

In an effort to integrate more of the student body, one of the council's goals is to provide roles to students who are not necessarily athletes.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cRight now we\u2019re hoping to get more student involvement within sports, not just athletics as in being a player on the team, but being an announcer, statistician or a team manager,\u201d Snodgrass said.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<strong>Wellness Committee: Integrating various wellness efforts<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The seven-person School Climate and Wellness Committee works with an intention to improve the well-being of students and staff at Paly by helping students de-stress.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe focus on mental health and communication between students and teachers, the state of the relationships between administrators and students, as well as students and parents,\u201d senior committee founder Cezanne Lane said.<\/span>\r\n\r\nThe committee also aims to help the various already existing wellness-related groups on campus work together.\u00a0The point of this committee is to bring all the student efforts together and to act as a liaison among them.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThere are different efforts going on in the realms of wellness,\" Lane said. \"There\u2019s Sources of Strength, as well as teacher, administration and board wellness efforts.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year, the committee will be hosting Change in Our Schools Week (previously known as Not in Our Schools Week), and it is\u00a0hopeful that involving several initiatives will strengthen the event. Working alongside science teacher Josh Bloom and Mental Health and Wellness Coordinator Jonathan Frecceri, co-leaders of Sources of Strength, the committee will work to dedicate one day to Sources.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Lane, the committee also works with Wellness Outreach Worker Julia Chang and Frecceri through the Wellness Center. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI\u2019ve been working really closely with them in planning and executing a lot of our events and ideas, so they\u2019re sort of our support system,\u201d Lane said.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recently the committee hosted a parent education night in the Media Arts Center that featured a panel of students discussing topics including interpersonal relationships, self care and post-high school plans.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cHopefully that [parent ed night] made the parent-student relationship better and we\u2019re relieving general pressure and stress,\u201d Lane said.<\/span>","excerpt":"Classic basketball jerseys, three-point contests, mindfulness and school climate; over the past year various committees have formed to improve the student experience at Paly.

Students would also have a better-balanced life.\r\n\r\nAlong with the qualification that a student must play a sport not offered at Paly,\u00a0he or she must have played the sport for three\u00a0years prior to applying for Independent Study PE. The student must train year-round for a minimum of 15 hours a week, five to six days a week.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, simply meeting all these standards is not enough to get an Independent Study prep. One must also go through a rigorous application process. This\u00a0process needs to be easier for all students to apply in order to prevent any student from being deterred from applying. Sophomore Kat Merk has been riding horses since she was seven years old. She trains with her coach three to four hours a day, six to seven days a week. For her, the process of applying for Independent Study PE was long and difficult.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI was very surprised at how lengthy [the Independent Study PE application process] was because I feel like a signature from the coach would be enough,\" Merk said. \"I had to prove that I had been working with her for a certain amount of time, I had to pull out paperwork of contracts, I had to prove that I had been to competitions. It was a little bit too much.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students in tenth grade at Palo Alto Unified School District schools that have successfully completed ninth grade Physical Education have the option of applying for Independent Study Physical Education,\u00a0according to the Paly course catalog. A student in Independent Study PE is given a prep period for the entire year instead\u00a0of taking a PE class.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paly offers cross country, water polo, football, golf, girls' volleyball, basketball, soccer, wrestling, baseball, lacrosse, swimming and diving, badminton, softball, track as well as cheer and dance. Therefore, students participating in any of these sports are not eligible for Independent Study.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to PE teacher and Independent Study program head Peter Diepenbrock, there is a specific reason students in Paly sports are not eligible for an\u00a0Independent Study PE\u00a0prep.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u201c[The purpose of Independent Study PE] is to give students that have been involved in a sport for many years and have dedicated a good portion of their lives to their sport, an opportunity to continue that sport.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students [playing a Paly sport cannot get a prep] because if you play a Paly sport, you already have an opportunity to get a prep for it.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some may argue that this makes sense. However, sports seasons are only a few months long at most. Students that are dedicated to their sport devote hours of their time in the off-season to training. Anyone playing a sport at a high level has hours of practice a day and trains almost every day of the week. Students spend all this time to improve at their sport so that when they go back to their Paly team, the Paly team is stronger.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to PE teacher David Duran, the purpose of PE is to get exercise and socialize with peers. PE helps maintain physical health through exercise and mental health with socialization.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cOur philosophy is [that] we want you to come and learn a skill, learn some social skills, burn some calories,\" Duran said. \"PE, for the most part, is a very social class, so there is a lot of interaction, unlike some other classes. And for the long range, [our hope] is that you actually value exercise, and 50 years from now you are still active and exercising because there are benefits both for your body and mind to be physically fit,\u201d Duran said.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though I agree with the goals and intents of PE as outlined by Duran, students who already play sports do not need PE to achieve those goals. A student who does over 15 hours of exercise a week clearly understands the value of exercise. While practicing a sport, they learn new skills, socialize, and burn calories. If they are already fulfilling these PE goals, they gain no benefit from taking part in PE.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the Paly PE syllabus, the three standards for PE are to:<\/span>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cDemonstrate knowledge and competency in motor skills, movement patterns, and strategies needed to perform a variety of physical activities.\"<\/span><\/li>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"Achieve a level of physical fitness for health and performance while demonstrating knowledge of fitness concepts, principles, and strategies.\"<\/span><\/li>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"Demonstrate knowledge of psychological and sociological concepts, principles, and strategies as they apply to learning and performance of physical activity.\u201d<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through playing any sport, a student automatically engages in all of these standards.\u00a0Playing a sport with the dedication of 15 hours a week means that a student has competent motor skills and movement abilities. They are physically fit and understand fitness concepts as they apply to their specific sport, but also athletics in general. Through coaching, they learn how psychological and sociological concepts affect their sport. It is unfair to assume that a student participating in a non-Paly sport automatically fulfills these criteria if they fulfill the ones required for an Independent Study prep, but a student playing a Paly sport doesn\u2019t. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A critical reason why students should be given an Independent Study prep for any sport that takes 15 hours per week is because students need the time to work on homework and study. Students agree that this prep is vital to their ability to succeed in schoolwork. Students such as Merk agree.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201c[An Independent Study prep] gives you more time to focus on your academics and doesn\u2019t take away from your physical education because you\u2019re doing plenty after school,\u201d said Merk.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Playing a sport is a time-consuming activity. One must factor in not only the length of practice and competitions, but also time for activities\u00a0such as transport and showering. While students who play 15 hours of sports a week already struggle to fit all of this into their schedule, students without a prep find it even more difficult. Without time during their prep to meet with teachers, work on homework, or study, students may fall behind in their classes. In order to combat this, students have to stay up later at night to work on schoolwork. According to a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25028798\">study<\/a> conducted at the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Harvard-Westlake <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">School, getting less than eight hours of sleep a night is the biggest predictor of injury for high school athletes\u00a0and a quarter of athletes who are injured miss at least a week of playing time.<\/span>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_128278\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"511\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/Screen-Shot-2017-01-21-at-9.06.26-PM.png\"><img class=\" wp-image-128278\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/Screen-Shot-2017-01-21-at-9.06.26-PM.png\" alt=\"From a study conducted at the Harvard-Westlake school.\" width=\"511\" height=\"161\" \/><\/a> From a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25028798\">study<\/a> conducted at the Harvard-Westlake school.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nIndependent Study preps are essential to Paly students because\u00a0it is unhealthy to constantly demand so much from these already over-achieving student athletes. A student's health should be their primary concern, and they should not have to sacrifice it to play a sport and do well in school.\r\n\r\nSophomore Sydney Liu is an avid softball player. Getting sleep and rest is the main reason she wants an Independent Study prep; however, because she plays softball, she cannot get one.\r\n\r\n\"People always say that students should get a minimum of\u00a0eight hours of sleep,\" Liu said. \"It's kind of hard to do that when I\u00a0spend a total of four hours almost every day traveling and practicing for [my]\u00a0sport. Getting that extra hour and a\u00a0half to do homework during school hours would really help me prevent going to bed at 12 every night.\"\r\n\r\nConsequently, while PE is a necessary class to keep students in shape, students who already do 15 hours of a sport outside of school should not be required to partake in it and should be given the option to easily\u00a0apply for\u00a0an Independent Study prep. This prep would keep help maintain both the physical and mental health of\u00a0students. Additionally, because\u00a0all sports are physically demanding and time-consuming, there should be no restriction on which sport a student must play in order to qualify for Independent Study PE.","excerpt":"In order to qualify for Independent Study Physical Education, a student must play a sport that is not offered at Palo Alto High School. \r\n","date":"2017-01-23 17:30:39","author":"Soumya Jhaveri","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/Screen-Shot-2017-01-21-at-8.42.27-PM-11.png","categories":["Opinion","Spotlight"],"tags":["diepenbrock","duran","independent study","kat merk","opinion","paly sports","pe","prep","sports"]}]
