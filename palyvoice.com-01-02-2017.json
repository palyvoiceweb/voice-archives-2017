The march sought predominantly to advocate for women's rights, but also to stand in solidarity with the diverse communities in our country, and for the freedom of expression and choice of individuals of all races, religions, ethnicities and sexual orientations, according to the Women's\u00a0March on Washington <a href=\"https:\/\/www.womensmarch.com\/mission\/\">website<\/a>.\r\n\r\nThe crowd of 2.5 million people across the world sent a strong signal, organizers said, to the world and our government that the coming years will be unfamiliar territory, the future a time of action and bold change.\r\n\r\nThe Paly Voice marched alongside the powerful crowd and gathered personal stories of those who felt it necessary to speak up that day.\r\n\r\n<strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; color: #ff99cc;\">Scenes from the San Fransisco Women's March<\/span><\/strong>\r\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/tpFMypWPvZA\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; color: #ff99cc;\"><strong>Locations of sister marches throughout California<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\r\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/d\/embed?mid=16Ryr-xl3ghrwTItdGlV_megnmqA\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\"><\/iframe>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-size: 18pt; color: #ff99cc;\"><strong>The Train\u00a0<\/strong><\/span>\r\n\r\nAt the Caltrain station on the way to the protest, Palo Altans formed a crowd sporting pink \"pussy hats,\" a reference to a leaked video of\u00a0President Trump remark's towards women\u00a0and holding bright colored signs. The line for the ticket booth, including this group of reporters for The Paly Voice, stretched to the other side of the station and the ticket dispensers ran out of exact change for the demonstrators. An excited energy of anticipation prickled the air as people stood waiting for the 2:30 p.m. train.\r\n\r\nStanford student Yaelle Viner was one demonstrator wearing a pink hat. She smiled through the cold air as she explained why she found it necessary to partake in the march.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have a 6-year-old sister, and granted she is a little young to understand socio-political issues, but I am marching so [that] she is able to see a world as progressive as I have seen in my lifetime,\u201d Viner said.\r\n\r\nHer friend, Grace Wallace, stressed the importance of advocating for intersectional feminism, emphasizing that we must remember how limited an individualist viewpoint can be.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_128533\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"370\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/trainstation.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-128533\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/trainstation.jpg\" alt=\"trainstation\" width=\"370\" height=\"247\" \/><\/a> Palo Alto student protesters Grace Wallace, Emma Rothenburg, Yaelle Viner and Sarah Vernalis hold a poster reading, \"I march for intersectional feminism.\" Photo: Rachel Code.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n\u201cI am marching to show that feminist causes are intersectional and apply to many different people,\" Wallace said. \u00a0\"All of them are equally valid and need to be heard. My sign reads, \u2018I march for intersectional feminism\u2019 and then on the back, \u2018not open-minded fascism.' Intersectionality is basically the theory that identities coalesce to form different experiences\u00a0so that the experience of a white-identifying woman and a black-identifying woman will not be the same and it is important to acknowledge those differences.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs the train arrived, the demonstrators filled the train-cars past their limit, no seat remained empty, no isle devoid of pink. People clung to the windows and each other, cramped on stairs and in walkways as they made their way into the city.\r\n\r\nBella Gaberal, a Gunn High School senior riding the Caltrain, reflected on the excitement of taking part in a global movement.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt\u2019s [The protest is] happening worldwide and in many countries,\u201d Gaberal\u00a0said. \u201cTo me it\u2019s just a promise to keep fighting.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\nAs the journey continued and the train reached the San Francisco station, the lines, between young and old, between the Palo-Altan and the San Francisco natives, between race, gender, ethnicity mingled into a\u00a0single entity as the crowd bonded in a common purpose.\r\n\r\nEmma Rothenburg, protester and college\u00a0student, grew up surrounded by\u00a0a powerful female environment. For her, it was important that her mom, her sister and all women and men alike were marching, although separated by miles, together.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am marching with my mother and sister \u2014 my mother is down in southern California and my sister will be in S.F. so I am joining them,\u201d Rothenburg said. \u201cI was raised by a strong female, who was also raised by another strong female and so on.\u00a0I know there is nothing a woman can't do and I want everyone to know that.\u201d\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_128548\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/littleboy1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-128548\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/littleboy1.jpg\" alt=\"littleboy\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" \/><\/a> A small boy sits on the shoulders of his father amidst the wild crowds of the San Francisco Women's March at the Civic Center Plaza on Jan. 21.

Instead, they embraced the cold dreary weather in a sort of protest, taking out pink rain jackets and vibrant umbrella\u2019s and craning their necks to listen to Supervisor Jane Kim as she passionately spoke into the microphone insisting that San Francisco has an important role in gender equality and women\u2019s rights. This was followed by speakers making statements about the election and \"moving forward.\"\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the night moved on, folk singer Joan Baez and queer hip hop artist <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MicahTron<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">performed, energizing the crowd and moving most to their feet regardless of age.

Originally from Brazil and working in a psychology department centered on children's rights issues, Santos explained in a heavy accent how we must view this march with a broad perspective, going farther than the streets of S.F. and even Washington.<\/span>\r\n\r\n\u201cI decided to come to the march because it is an international movement,\" dos Santos said. \"There is a conservative movement taking over the country \u2014 in Brazil it is also happening.

Thousands of people poured into dark San Francisco streets lit up by red lanterns, the light reflecting off puddles and raindrops still clinging to umbrellas and jackets, that in turn illuminated the streets with a warm flickering glow. Loud chants echoed through the city, voices joining through the soft pattering of rain as the storm subsided.\r\n\r\nAccording to dos Santos, while walking in the rain a special energy took over the crowd.\r\n\r\n\u201cWalking, I felt the sensation of coming together, of thousands of people coming together,\" dos Santos said. \"I like the energy, the energy that comes out of these gatherings. I feel like oh my God, these people, we are talking about the same language. The energy is part of it, it helps us see how people can make a difference.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn Brazil,\u201d dos Santos added, \u201cit would probably be louder, with dancing. Here it was very orderly and quiet, but I like the phrases that were said.

However, they weren\u2019t alone; backing them up were hundreds of protesters from around the Bay Area. Among the crowd were several students,\u00a0who told The Paly Voice that\u00a0they had no plan to leave until those five people walked out of the terminal with them.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the attending Paly students, junior Lia Straight, said she felt compelled to join the protest because she wanted to aid\u00a0detainees as well as stand up against the current state of US politics.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n\u201cI decided to go to the protest today because if I didn't go, if I didn't stand up and fight everyone's rights, who else would?\u201d Straight said. \u201cI'm not a lawyer. I'm not anyone in a position of power, but I can go to this protest and I can help shut down SFO and put pressure on Trump and our government to stop violating people's rights and the Constitution.\u201d\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the other attending students, sophomore\u00a0Harrison Frahn, recounted\u00a0learning about the implications of Trump's ban from his fellow protesters.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI talked to several people who were immigrants or refugees, and were allowed to come to the U.S. legally,\u201d Frahn said. \u201cOne of them told me that it took him seven whole years to get his green card after he came to the U.S., and he that it took others even longer. This just shows how clueless the Trump administration is, because to get a green card, you already have to go through extremely extensive screening, and now, with the ban, you are not even allowed to enter the country.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_128866\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"309\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/voicesfo2.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-128866\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/voicesfo2.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters block escalators in SFO's international terminal.

Restaurants sent us food, people told stories of how Trump's executive order affected them, moms brought their toddlers and set up stations to make signs [and] people supported one another. SFO is a very large airport, but it felt incredibly small with the [tens] of hundreds of protestors screaming and chanting and taking up space, persisting in this fight for people's rights.\u201d\r\n\r\nFrahn echoed Straight's sentiments.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt was very uplifting to see that there are so many people united against hate and discrimination and that so many people are willing to fight for the rights of others,\" Frahn said. \"We were all there to show the Trump administration that the American people will stand up for the rights of all people, to show that not all Americans support the kind of discriminatory policies that the Trump administration is putting in place and that we will fight to make sure that nobody is treated unfairly or discriminated against based on their beliefs.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After a weekend of full of marching, chanting and pure determination, protesters received word that the five detainees had been released at around 7 p.m. Sunday evening.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt felt like we were all making history,\u201d Straight said. \u201cWe surrounded the entire international terminal of SFO with a thick band of protestors, marching and chanting.

Playing in his second consecutive season on the Palo Alto High School boys' basketball team (16-2, 7-0), Rojahn and\u00a0fellow three-point juggernaut junior guard\u00a0Jared Wulbrun, have become the \"splash brothers\" of the Paly team. Rojahn provided the spark to the Vikings' domination of the Gunn High School Titans' basketball team (11-7, 2-5) on Friday, 79-36, hitting a couple three-pointers in the opening minutes, electrifying the crowd and setting the tone for the rest of the night.\u00a0With half of the regular season in the books, the Vikings remain the top dogs in the De Anza League.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_128729\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"475\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/spencer-celebrating.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-128729\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/spencer-celebrating.jpg\" alt=\"Junior guard Spencer Rojahn gets pumped up by fellow junior guard Brey Johnson pregame.

Rojahn hit two early three-pointers on Friday against Gunn High School. Photo: Rachel Code[\/caption]\r\n\r\nOver the course of play, Paly's swarming defense proved to be too much to handle for the Titans. Midway through the second quarter, Paly scored on three consecutive stolen passes and did not\u00a0allow the Gunn offense to pass the half-court line during those three possessions. A combination of the\u00a0Viking starting lineups' average height of just under six foot three inches and\u00a0a strong press defense enabled Paly to play at its desired game tempo and forced countless Titan turnovers.\r\n\r\nTo accompany the exceptional play of the starting lineup, \u00a0junior point guard Will Schmutz subbed in for senior starting point guard and team captain Miles Tention in the second half and excited the crowd with 11 points of his own. \"MVP\" chants erupted from the Paly sections following each of Schmutz's baskets. Also off the bench, junior guard Brey Johnson, junior center Bryant Jefferson, senior point guard Ethan Stern and senior guard Jack Simison added to the insurmountable Viking lead with a combined 25 points off the bench. Johnson added the exclamation point on the blowout win with a huge block on a Gunn guard during the closing minutes of the game.\r\n\r\nThe Titans struggled to find their groove on offense, ending the game without a double-digit scorer. Gunn senior forward Jeffery Lee-Heidenreich led the Titans with nine points, and senior guard Josh Radin poured in six of his own.\r\n\r\nPaly head coach Peter Diepenbrock said the Vikings' continued dominance has played a large factor in the team's mindset moving forward.\r\n\r\n\"We've won eight games\u00a0in a row and we keep improving so it's huge,\" Diepenbrock said. \"This win reconfirms what we're trying to do and it shows that we're going in the right direction.\"\r\n\r\nDespite the lengthy winning streak, Diepenbrock has seen this story before and said the team needs to remain grounded after its successes. Last season, the Vikings headed into the Central Coast Section playoffs having won the majority of the match-ups leading up the first round of CCS\u00a0but\u00a0were defeated in the first round.\r\n\r\n\"That's the challenge,\" Diepenbrock said. \"We have to be a much more mature team. Last year we couldn't handle this so hopefully we will keep practicing hard and keep our focus because we have bigger goals than just to win the league.\"\r\n\r\nJunior forward William Schlemmer said the team needs to remain grounded despite the big win\u00a0and understand that the Vikings will need to continue to improve in order to compete with some of their tougher opponents.\r\n\r\n\"We need to tower on half-court offense because the games we have difficulty in are those where the pace is slower and we can't get buckets in transition,\" Schlemmer said. \"This game shows that we need to be able to play with the intensity of [the Gunn game] every game even though we might not be as excited\u00a0because if we play as intensely as we do against Gunn,\u00a0we are hard to stop.\"\r\n\r\nThe Vikings outscored the Titans 21-2 in just under six minutes of play\u00a0and continued to add to their lead, heading into\u00a0the half with a sizable 38-18 advantage. Paly would go on to obliterate Gunn for the second and final time this year by a score of 79-36, beating the Titans\u00a0by 14 more points that the matchup earlier this season. Diepenbrock encourages the Paly community to bring the same roaring energy to the Vikings'\u00a0next big match-up on Saturday at Menlo-Atherton High School.\r\n\r\n\"Get it done. How much fun could that be?\" Depenbrock said. \"Going into an opposing gym and having the [expletive] place covered. Go to [Menlo-Atherton].\"\r\n\r\nUp next for the Vikings are league rematches against teams the boys already defeated handily. On Tuesday, the Vikings face the Los Altos High School Eagles (10-9, 2-5) at Los Altos and on Friday, Paly faces off against the Wilcox High School Chargers (9-9, 4-3).\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"The Vikings' dominated the Gunn High School Titans' basketball team (11-7, 2-5) on Friday, 79-36.
